<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
Doctor Edward Pethwick,
mathematics and physics master
at the Liverpool School, was sitting
at a window in his room adjoining the
senior physics laboratory.  He had laid
aside the calculation on which he was
engaged, in order to watch the proceedings
in the playing fields beneath the window.
The Officers' Training Corps was coming
on parade in readiness for a rehearsal of
tomorrow's review by a general from the
War Office.  Today they were being
reviewed merely by a general who did not
use the title—Mr. Henry Laxton, C.M.G.,
D.S.O., M.A., Headmaster of the Liverpool
School, who had risen during the war from
the rank of captain in the Territorial
Army to the command of a brigade, and
when the war was over had returned to the
teaching profession and had accepted this
headmastership.  It gave the school a
decided prestige to have at its head a
brigadier-general, because even though he
punctiliously never used the title everyone who
mattered knew that it was his by right.
</p>

<p>
At the moment his son, Henry Laxton
the Second, Captain of the School and
Sergeant of No. 3 Platoon, was bringing
his detachment on to the parade-ground.
He walked with a swagger which was an
improvement on that of the regular
sergeant-major's; he handled his
silver-topped cane to the manner born; and the
long bayonet which swung on his hip
rhythmically with his stride was the
finishing touch to his soldierly appearance.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick saw his dark eyes beneath his
cap peak gauging carefully, but without
hurry, the distance between the head of
his column and the space where No. 3
platoon should be.  Then young Laxton
shouted the order—although "shout" is
too barbaric a word for that beautifully
modulated word of command.
</p>

<p>
"At the halt, on the left form—platoon."
</p>

<p>
No. 3 platoon came up into line exactly
where it ought to have been, and stood
rigid.
</p>

<p>
"Order—<i>hype</i>.  Standa—<i>tease</i>."
</p>

<p>
The fifty rifles came down like one; the
fifty left feet made only one sound as they
were pushed out.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick, watching from the window,
knew he could never have done anything
like that.  His voice would have risen to a
squeak with excitement.  He would have
misjudged the distance hopelessly, so that
the little devils at the head of the platoon
would have bumped delightedly into the
line ahead of them.  He could not conceive
of himself ever having fifty boys under
such perfect control as to order arms and
stand at ease without a fidget or a wriggle
anywhere along the line.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick was conscious of a vague envy
of young Laxton.  He envied him the calm
self-confidence of his carriage, his coolness,
and his efficiency in action.  He ranked
young Laxton in his mind with all the
people whom he described to himself—drawing
upon a vague memory of Fiona
Macleod's <i>Immortal Hour</i>—as "the Lordly
Ones," people who could do things in front
of other people without fumbling at their
neckties.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick tried to comfort himself by
thinking of things which he could do with
ease and which were quite beyond young
Laxton's capacity; only that very morning
in class Laxton had come down badly in
attempting to demonstrate Cayley's proof
of the Binomial Theorem, which to
Pethwick was literally no more abstruse than
the addition of two and two.  But there
was somehow no comfort in the memory,
for Pethwick was of such an unfortunate
mental composition as to find no pleasure
in the malicious contemplation of other
people's difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Down on the parade-ground the regular
sergeant-major and young Laxton had
posted the markers—this was a very
formal parade, indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Markers, <i>steady</i>."
</p>

<p>
The drums rolled as the lines dressed.
The officers were on parade now,
Pethwick's colleagues all of them, Summers
with his medals, Malpas and Stowe trim in
their new uniforms, Hicks still tugging at
his gloves—he, too, was not of the Lordly
Ones.  Swords were drawn and glittered
in the sun.  It was rare indeed for swords
to be seen in the playing fields of the
Liverpool School.  The khaki ranks stood
fast, motionless.  The very atmosphere
seemed charged with a tension which told
that the great moment of the day was at
hand.
</p>

<p>
Then the doors of the school hall
towards which the parade was facing flew
open, and the headmaster stepped out.
Summers bawled an order.  The band
played a lively march—making a horrible
hash of the opening bars—and the swords
flashed as they came to the salute, and
the rifles came to the present as though
actuated by one single vast machine.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton's appearance fully justified
all this ceremony.  He was not in uniform—after
all, this was only a rehearsal of
tomorrow's review—but by a happy thought
he was wearing morning clothes, superb
in cut and style, setting just the right note
of informal formality.  He stood with his
yellow gloves and silver-mounted stick in
one hand and his silk hat raised in the
other during the general salute, and then
he came forward, while Summers hastened
to meet him, to walk along the lines in
formal inspection.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick continued to watch and
suffer.  He knew that if he were to put on
a morning coat he would look like a seedy
shop-walker.
</p>

<p>
And then Dr. Pethwick's heart gave a
little kick inside his ribs.  Mr. Laxton was
now standing at the flagstaff which
marked the saluting-point, and by his side
was a young woman in a brown summer
frock, talking animatedly.  It was his
daughter Dorothy, whom Dr. Pethwick
considered to be the sweetest, most beautiful,
most lovely of all the Lordly Ones.
</p>

<p>
Even leaving out of account the fact
that Dr. Pethwick was a married man, it
is remarkable that he had come to
differentiate between Lordly Ones to such an
extent that the sight of one particular one
of them a hundred yards away should send
up his pulse-rate, while none of the others
affected him in any such manner.  Yet if
Dr. Pethwick had been able to put his
feelings into words, he would have said that
Dorothy Laxton was a fountain of sweetness,
and that within the circle of Dorothy
Laxton's arms (although he had no personal
experience) lay all the bliss and rest
and happiness of any conceivable paradise.
Even looking at her over the playing-fields
brought a pain into his breast—a pain in
which he found an odd pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick gulped and looked away,
allowing his mind, for the first time for a
quarter of an hour, to revert to the
calculation which half covered the large sheet
of paper before him.  The expression he
was dealing with there included half the
Greek alphabet and half the English, as
well as eight or nine other symbols which
only come to light in mathematical
textbooks.  Even Dr. Pethwick had found
himself floundering a little helplessly at the
moment when young Laxton had marched
up No. 3 platoon to distract him.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
When the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>
writes its little biographies of
mathematicians and similar odd people, it is
generous enough in its praise of their
achievements.  Sometimes, indeed, it even
condescends to some small detail of their
private lives, saying, perhaps, "for the next
twenty years he was happily occupied as
Professor of Mathematics at So-and-So
University," and sometimes even, it goes
so far as to give a vague hint of "domestic
trouble, or illness."  But from those poor
data it is hard to conjure up a complete
picture of the life of such a man as
Pethwick, of the troubles and distractions
caused him by such things as far
unconnected with mathematics as his strong
views upon disarmament and the facts
that he loved his headmaster's daughter,
and that a silk hat did not suit his looks,
and that his wife was a slovenly and
malicious drunkard, or even that the Officers'
Training Corps should choose to hold a
rehearsal of a review under the windows
of his room, in the afternoon following a
morning when Vb had been badly behaved
and the Upper Sixth had been worse.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps all these dissimilar ingredients
contributed to the sigh with which
Pethwick picked up his pen again in his long,
beautiful fingers and addressed himself
to the tangle of neat symbols while,
outside, the band blared and the Officers'
Training Corps plunged into the
complicated wheel which was to get them into
position for the march past.
</p>

<p>
It is conceivable that the distraction did
Pethwick good, that the few minutes
during which his mind had been empty of his
work gave it an opportunity to rally for
the last final effort.  But it is just as
likely that the stimulus given to his
circulation and reactions by the distant sight
of Dorothy Laxton may have been responsible.
However it was, Pethwick's pen
moved across the paper without hesitation
for some minutes.  Line was added to line
of the calculation.  Two nasty corners were
turned by ingenious devices.  The
expression simplified itself.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick's eyebrows rose at one
discovery; it was all very surprising.  If he
had been able to carry the calculation in
his head he might have deduced all this
weeks ago, and he was rather annoyed with
himself for not having done so—he told
himself that Gauss or Clerk Maxwell would
have achieved the feat easily; in that he
was wrong, betrayed into error by his
habitual poor opinion of his own capacity.
</p>

<p>
The mathematical expression had been
reduced now to the simplest form such a
thing could possibly attain, and Pethwick
looked at it with surprise.  This was not
what he had started to prove.  He had set
out to find a zero, and here was definite
evidence that there was not a zero to be
found; that when all allowances had been
made there was a substantial residuum
left over.
</p>

<p>
That was how Pethwick regarded it;
actually he deserved a good deal more credit.
Before he had set about this calculation
the flair, the inspiration, which denotes
the great scientist had told him that there
might perhaps be this residuum despite the
general consensus of mathematical
opinion.  The notion had bothered him until
he had determined to settle it once and
for all.  Now he had proved himself right,
proved that the two minor factors to which
a whole series of keen minds had refused
to attach importance were important after
all, and he had already formed an erroneous
estimate of his own achievement.  He
told himself that he had believed he would
reach a zero and had reached a positive
result instead, whereas actually in his
heart of hearts he had known all along
that he would reach that result.  But
Pethwick could never give himself credit for
anything.
</p>

<p>
All the same, it was equally characteristic
of him that he did not look back
through his calculation to check its
correctness.  He knew that was all right.  The
only doubtful point was whether Klein's
original figures, with Norbury's
elaborations of them, were accurate.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick looked again at Norbury's
eloquent paragraphs in the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society which
had originally inspired his investigation.
Klein was probably accurate, and Norbury
was certainly right as far as he had
gone—which was not very far.  At that rate
the result which Pethwick had reached
was exceedingly interesting mathematically.
The experimental investigation
which should follow would also be
interesting.  Pethwick was not very excited
at the thought of that.  He was much more
of a mathematician than a physicist, and
his lack of self-assurance made him
continually doubtful of his manipulative skill.
</p>

<p>
But something might easily come of his
discovery.  There might be some
application in the arts, in several directions.
Electrical generation might be simplified,
or for that matter broadcasting, or
motorcar ignition.  Because Pethwick had spent
three weeks wrestling with figures
housewives all over the world might find their
electric irons cheaper to run, or little
clerks might come home from their offices
to listen in with more efficient radio sets,
or ten million motorists in ten million
garages would have to give one fewer turn
to the cranks of their motor-cars on cold
mornings.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick smiled with one side of his
mouth at the exuberance of his imagination.
There was an enormous distance between
a row of figures on a sheet of paper
and the general adoption of an invention
which might possibly spring from bench
experiments which might perhaps follow
from those figures.  But still, such was the
stimulus given to his mind by this extravagant
imagination of his that he resolved to
carry out the very next day a few simple
practical confirmations of his theoretical
deductions.  As he put his papers away in
his desk he was already listing in his mind
pieces of apparatus which he would need
for preliminary work, and which the
resources of the senior physics laboratory at
the Liverpool School could provide.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
As Dr. Edward Pethwick came out
of the Science Buildings of the school
into the courtyard (Mr. Laxton discountenanced
the use of the word "playground,"
which had generally been employed
before his accession) he encountered his
headmaster and his headmaster's daughter
coming away from the saluting point now
that the review was over.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick lifted off his hat and passed
on.  Mr. Laxton nodded with a
condescension which was made all the more
remarkable by his morning coat and silk
hat.  Dorothy smiled very charmingly
indeed.  And as Dr. Pethwick went on,
conscious of the fact that his coat crumpled
below its collar, and that his soft hat was
shabby, and his shoes unclean, Mr. Laxton
cocked his head sideways after him and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Queer bloke, that."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton was of the type that cannot
help making a comment about anyone he
happened to encounter.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Pethwick?  I like him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's all right, I suppose, in his way.
But you have to be a damn' good disciplinarian
before you can dress like that in
a boys' school, you know, Dorothy.  And he's not."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think he was," said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy, as a matter of fact, was always
reminded by Dr. Pethwick's appearance of
the White Knight to <i>Through the
Looking-Glass</i>—perhaps the most lovable character
in English fiction, but hardly of the type
to keep order in a secondary school.
</p>

<p>
"Honestly, Dorothy, I ought to get rid of
him," said Mr. Laxton.  "He can't keep
discipline, and he can't teach, and he's no
good at games, and his wife—"
</p>

<p>
"Don't let's talk about his wife," said
Dorothy.  She had heard too much about
Mrs. Pethwick; wherever two or three
women were gathered together in that
suburb there was always some discussion
of Mrs. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"But then, I don't know," said Mr. Laxton.
"I thought about it when I first came
here, and decided against sacking him
then, and the same arguments hold good
now, I suppose.  He's an old boy of the
school, you know, and although he is a
London man, he's the only one left on the
staff, thank God.  Did I tell you the new
man who's coming next term is Winchester
and New?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Father," said Dorothy.  She thought
of adding, but refrained, "Several times."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, so I did.  What were we talking
about before that?  Oh, Pethwick.  I didn't
tell you that that astronomer chap on the
board of governors—what's his name?—Runciman,
that's it—was talking to me
about a couple of papers of Pethwick's in
some mathematical journal or other.
Marvellous stuff, Runciman was saying."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Dorothy, with a trace of
interest.  "What were they about?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me, girl.  It's not my line, as
you know jolly well.  But Runciman
obviously thought the world of him—'A very
brilliant young mathematician, evidently,'
and all that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"Young?" questioned Dorothy, who was
twenty-three.
</p>

<p>
"God bless my soul, yes," said Mr. Laxton.
"He's not much older than you are.  I see
his name on the honours board every time
I take prayers in hall.  He got his
degree—B.Sc.—in 1921, and I know he was nineteen
at the time.  He's thirty-one.  Got his
doctorate at twenty-four.  Runciman was
talking to me about his thesis at the same time
as the other things."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy remembered guiltily that only
last week she had decided that she would
marry someone just over thirty, as that
was the most suitable age.  It was a shock
to her to realize that Dr. Pethwick was
that age, although she had never pictured
herself married to him.
</p>

<p>
"I hope," mused Mr. Laxton, "that he
does something really brilliant soon.
Suppose he became as famous as Einstein.
Think what a lot of good that would do
to the school."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton had ambitions regarding the
school.  He wished to raise it to
pre-eminence among secondary schools—nay
more, he had visions of making a public
school of it, and himself attaining the
lofty distinction of admission to the Public
School Headmasters' Conference.  In the
last three years he had done much towards
it; he had weeded out all the members of
the staff—save for Dr. Pethwick—who did
not hold degrees from Oxford or Cambridge;
there was even a half-blue on the
staff.  He had introduced the practice of
corporal punishment and the teaching of
Greek—although his board of governors
had so far managed to prevent him from
making Greek a compulsory subject for
the tradesmen's sons and small clerks' sons
who were his pupils.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton's chief trouble was the name
of the school.  Everyone who was not
initiated thought that the Liverpool school
must be in Liverpool, a mere provincial
place, instead of, as was actually the case,
owing its name to its Victorian founder
and being in a suburb of London as near
to the heart of things as St. Paul's and
Dulwich College and Merchant Taylors',
which everyone knew to be real public
schools.  Even the Old Boys would not help
him much.  They insisted on calling
themselves Old Liverpudlians—a disgustingly
provincial name—and remained stone-deaf
to hints from the headmaster that he
would welcome any movement to change
the name into something more airy and
gentlemanly.
</p>

<p>
In Mr. Laxton's mind the retention of
Dr. Pethwick on the staff was a noble
gesture, a magnificent recognition of the
rise of democracy, a most notable example
of the fact that nowadays a career was
always open to talent.  For Dr. Pethwick
had no education beyond the Liverpool
School and the University of London.
Everyone knew that he was only the son
of a local saddler—dead now, thank
God—and that he had all sorts of queer
cousins and relations still living in the district
who were only working-class people.  And
also that he had a terrible wife—of the
same class, of course.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
At that very moment Dr. Pethwick
was hoping, as he put his key into his
front door, that his wife was not going
to be "difficult" this evening.  And as he
came into the front hall he knew that she
was.  She came out of the dining room with
that heaviness and exaggeration of gait
which foretold the worst.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" said Mary Pethwick.  Then she
put out her hand against the wall and
rested against it in a negligent sort of
way.  Her demeanour indicated that there
was no real need for this support; she did
it from choice, not to keep her balance.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, dear," said Pethwick, hanging
up his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Your tea's not ready," said Mary, as
though it were his fault.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it doesn't matter," replied
Pethwick.  "I'll get it myself."
</p>

<p>
He edged past her along the hall into
the little kitchen; she made no effort to
get out of his way but stood watching
every step he took.  The little kitchen was
full of squalor.  On the gas stove stood the
frying pan in which had been cooked the
breakfast bacon.  The sink and the small
table beside it were covered with dirty
saucepans and dishes.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick looked round for the kettle,
found it in the littered pantry, filled it and
set it on the stove.  Then he heard Mary's
blundering step down the hall, and she
came in after him; the door, pushed open a
shade too violently, crashed against the
wall.
</p>

<p>
Mary put her back against the wall
beside the dresser and watched his movements
jealously.  In that tiny room, littered
as it was, there was hardly room for
Pethwick to move now.  Pethwick sighed; he
was experienced now in Mary's
"difficultness."  When she followed him about like
this it meant that she was looking for an
opportunity to grumble.  The only shadow
of comfort left was that as the grumbling
was quite inevitable it did not matter what
he did.
</p>

<p>
He cleared the little table by stacking
the dirty things neatly in the sink—until
that was done there was nowhere where
anything could be set down for a second.
He washed out the teapot.  He found,
miraculously, a clean cup and saucer and
plate.  There were fragments of a broken
jug under the sink.  The only other two
jugs in the house were dirty and greasy;
he would have to pour his milk direct from
the bottle—there was, fortunately, a little
left.  There was a smear of butter on the
breadboard.  The half loaf had stood since
morning in the sunshine coming through
the kitchen window, its cut surface was
hard and dry.
</p>

<p>
An incautious movement on Pethwick's
part set his foot on the saucer of milk put
down for the cat beside the stove.  It
broke under his heel, and the milk
streamed across the dirty floor.
</p>

<p>
"There!" said Mary.  "Look what you've
done!  All over my nice clean kitchen!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, dear," said Pethwick.  "I'll
mop it up."
</p>

<p>
He picked up a dishcloth from beside the
sink and stooped over the mess.
</p>

<p>
"That's a teacloth," screamed Mary.
"Don't use a teacloth for that!"
</p>

<p>
Pethwick put it back where he found it;
the colour of the thing made the mistake
excusable. He found something else,
mopped up the mess, put the cloth back,
and began cutting himself bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
"Look how you're wasting the gas!" said
Mary.
</p>

<p>
The kettle was boiling.  Mary often left
kettles boiling until the bottom was burnt
out of them, and she did not mind in the
least how much gas was used, but she had
to find something to harass her husband
with.  Pethwick made his tea, and went on
cutting bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
"That's all the bread there is," said Mary,
again as if it were his fault.  Pethwick
checked himself in the act of cutting.  Half
a small loaf is not much if it has to
constitute a man's evening meal and two
persons' breakfast.  Incautiously he
allowed himself to say something which
might be construed as displaying a little
annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't the baker come today?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's not my fault if he comes when I'm
out," said Mary, leaping into the long
sought opening.  "Fancy saying that to me!
Do you expect—"
</p>

<p>
There is no need to give a verbatim
account of what Mary Pethwick went on
saying.  The fact that Pethwick had dared
to hint that she had neglected her
domestic duties was a splendid starting point,
from which she could counter-attack in
righteous indignation.  With malice she
poisoned her barbed words.  She knew,
with the ingenuity of evil, how to wound.
She jeered at his proverbial inability to
keep a class in order, at his untidy
appearance, at all the weaknesses of which
he was conscious and for which he was
ashamed.
</p>

<p>
Some husbands, sitting silent, could have
let her words pass unheeded, practically
unheard, but that was impossible to
Pethwick.  He was far too sensitive a man.  He
listened, and every word hurt.  The stale
bread and butter he was trying to eat at
the kitchen table turned in his mouth to
something more like sawdust than ever.
The bitter strong tea to which he had
looked forward was too bitter to drink.  He
pushed his cup away and rose from the
table, to be censured again, of course, for
the sin of waste.  Mary had no objection to
making use of the most ridiculous charges
against him.  They gave her time to think
of more wounding things without having
to check her speech.
</p>

<p>
Only one thing ever caused her to pause.
It came now, while Pethwick stood waiting
for the kettle to boil before beginning
to wash up.  Mary said suddenly that she
could no longer bear the sight of him.  It
was a splendid excuse for moving away
with dignity.  Pethwick heard her go along
the hall and into the dining-room, and he
heard the sideboard door there open and
close.  He knew why.  Then in a little while
the kitchen door crashed open again and
Mary came back to renew the onset, all
the while that Pethwick was trying to
wash clean the greasy dishes and saucepans.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
When the washing up was completed
Pethwick went into the drawing-room
and unpacked from his bag the thirty-one
exercise books which contained the physics
homework of Vb, but in the next two hours
he only succeeded in marking two of them,
and those were during the two intervals
when Mary went into the dining-room to
the sideboard cupboard.  The other
twenty-nine took him hardly more than an hour
after Mary had gone up to bed, heavily and
slowly, pulling herself up by the banisters.
</p>

<p>
And if it be asked why Pethwick endured
treatment of this sort without
revolt, the answer can only be found in his
heredity and his environment.  The
saddler, his father, had been a thoughtful
little wisp of a man; his mother had been
a big masterful woman of generous figure,
not at all unlike, in her young days, the
woman Pethwick married—who was her
niece, and, consequently, Pethwick's
cousin.  That big bullying mother of his had
much to answer for.  She won her little
white-faced son's love and frightened him
out of his life in turns.
</p>

<p>
The years of Edward Pethwick's adolescence
were a lunatic time, when there was
war, and air-raids, and his father's
earnings amounted more than once to nearly a
thousand pounds in the year.  Mrs. Pethwick
lived gloriously, never more than
half-drunk but rarely less, and in time
Mr. Pethwick came to follow her example.
Other people bought pianos and fur coats;
the Pethwicks made a more magnificent
gesture still and sent their son to a
secondary school instead of putting him to
work at fourteen.  They destined him to be
the first member of their family on either
side to earn his living by his brain instead
of by his hands.
</p>

<p>
The result was that Edward Pethwick
matriculated at sixteen before the war was
over, and took his degree at nineteen very
brilliantly indeed just before his parents
quitted a world where a saddler's earnings
had shrunk to an amount which would
hardly suffice to make two people drunk
even once a week.
</p>

<p>
Where the mathematical talent came
from in Pethwick's make-up it is hard to
tell.  That particular mental twist is
strongly hereditary, but it is hard to find any
other example of it either in Pethwick's
father's family or in his mother's.  But as
none of them, as far as can be ascertained,
ever stayed at school long enough for any
talent of that sort to be discovered it is
possible that it was present but latent
among them.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick married at twenty.  He would
have had to have been a clever man to
avoid that fate.  For on the death of his
parents his aunt had taken care of him,
and within the year the combined efforts
of the whole of his aunt's family were
successful in their aim.  It was a tremendous
prize, for Pethwick was a member of a
profession, a school-teacher, not merely
several rungs higher up the social ladder
than his wife's family, but he might be
said to be on another ladder from theirs
altogether.
</p>

<p>
His very salary at twenty was far larger
than his father-in-law earned at fifty.  If
Mary had not married him she would have
had to hope that the time would come
when perhaps some shop assistant or lorry
driver would in an unguarded moment
give her the opportunity of snatching him
out of bachelorhood.
</p>

<p>
As it was, Mary won a colossal prize—a
house with three bedrooms in it and no
lodgers at all (until she married Mary
never lived in a house with less than two
families); a husband with a job which
more likely than not would continue safely
for forty years (he was the only man she
knew with a job of more than a week's
permanency); more clothes than she could
wear and more food than she could eat,
where previously there had been no
certainty of even a minimum of either.
Shop-keepers would treat her with deference,
where previously she had been accustomed
to a state of society where the shop-keeper
was a man of social distinction to whom
customers deferred.
</p>

<p>
In eleven years Mary had grown used to
it—eleven years of nothing much to do and
no particular desire to do it.  For that
matter, in two months Mary had grown bored
with her new house and her new furniture
so that even her mother's generous envy
was no longer sweet to her.  There was a
bottle of stout to drink at lunch time.
Her mother liked gin but could so rarely
afford it that it was nice to have some
handy when she came.
</p>

<p>
And when she went to visit her family
and in the evening went, as a matter of
course, to the "King's Arms," it was nice,
when her turn came, to say, "Won't you
make it a short one this time?" and to
have a Scotch herself, and to take out of
her purse a couple of half-crowns to pay
for all—more than her father could spend
there in a week without going short on
something else.  It was not very long before
Pethwick was quite used to coming home
to a wife with something the matter with
her temper.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
If only Mary had found something to
keep her occupied before the habit of
solitary drinking took hold of her, she
might have been a good wife.  If children
had come—lots of them—or if Pethwick
had been a severe taskmaster, or if Mary
had been ambitious as regards clothes, or
social position, or food, or if, incredibly,
she had developed a talent for art or
literature, matters might have been
different.  But as it was she had plunged into
idleness, she had found idleness unsatisfying,
and she had come to dull her racing
mind with drink.  After all, it was excusable.
The only people Mary knew considered
a man fortunate to be drunk, and it
took so little even now, to unbalance her
that the habit was easily formed.
</p>

<p>
Nor was her husband any help to her.
He was far too queer a person.  He could
never see any attraction in drink—he had
the complete distaste for it which occasionally
characterizes the offspring of drunken
parents—and he was a fool about his wife.
She and his mother were the only women
he had ever known, and he thought women
were marvellous beings, and ten years of
married life had no more widened his
knowledge of them than ten years of
mathematical research had done.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick put Vb's physics homework
away in his bag, switched off the light, and
went up to bed.  The nightly routine of
washing his hands and cleaning his teeth
relieved his mind of much of the tension
and distress the evening had brought him,
and when he went into the bedroom Mary
was, heaven be praised, already asleep,
snoring a little, with her clothes strewn
about the room.  Pethwick put on his
ragged pyjamas and climbed quietly in
beside her.  There were nights when Mary's
visits to the dining-room sideboard only
made her more and more wakeful and,
consequently, quarrelsome, and these were
nights of purgatory for Pethwick, but
happily this was not one of them.
</p>

<p>
He could compose himself on the pillow
and allow his current of thought, clear
now, and unhurried, to flow through his
mind.  He thought about Officers'
Training Corps, and Dorothy Laxton and Vb's
bad behaviour and the chance of cramming
Dawson through the intermediate
B.Sc. this summer.  And while that side
of his brain was digesting these matters,
the other side was developing the
consequences of his mathematical discovery of
that afternoon.  It went steadily on
regardless of his other thoughts, like a
clock ticking in a drawing-room where a
party is going on, attracting no attention
but turning the hands unfalteringly.
</p>

<p>
Then it broke in upon his consciousness,
staggeringly, as though the drawing-room
clock were suddenly to strike with Big
Ben's volume of sound.  That mathematical
expression at which his calculations had
ended in the afternoon had transformed
itself in his mind, had assumed a vital new
guise, presenting itself with clarity as a
stunning revelation.  Pethwick's heart beat
faster even than if he were thinking about
Dorothy Laxton, and for once in his life
he had no thought to spare for her.  He
was making his way from point to point
of a new deduction in that highly rarefied
atmosphere where mathematics tend to
become not merely a measure of, but
identical with, electro-magnetics and
electro-kinetics.
</p>

<p>
He knew now that he was progressing
towards not merely an interesting
mathematical discovery which might make a
flutter in the Royal Society and which
might just possibly affect practical
electro-magnetics to some slight degree, but that
he was about to find something else;
something much more important, a
completely new development, a physical
reaction of a kind hitherto unknown, whose
nature he could now see clearly although
only experimental test could determine
its amplitude.  It might be something very
small, measured by practical standards—Pethwick
could picture ingenious lecturers
devising neat little mechanisms for
displaying what would be called the
Klein-Pethwick Effect—or it might be great, very
great indeed, so great as perhaps to affect
the history of the world.
</p>

<p>
We all know now that it was great
enough to do so, and indeed might have
done so if Pethwick had been only a
mathematician, and not a man married to a
drunken wife, and in love with his
headmaster's daughter, and subject to all the
other influences which these pages have
endeavoured to describe.  But to get back
to the amazing train of events which,
like a tropical hurricane, began with an
innocent enough disturbance of a minor
sort—
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Holliday was one of those bluff
and burly young men who stand no
nonsense from boys.  As the assistant
physics master at the Liverpool School he was
just as efficient as at the nets where the
boys liked him even when they did not
know that he had only just missed his
Blue as a fast bowler for Cambridge.  He
never had any qualms about discipline.
He could face and tackle any crisis.
</p>

<p>
On that historic occasion a year ago
when some naughty boys hid a parcel of
fish in a locker in the laboratory on the
day before the half-term holiday, so that
when the school reopened four days later
the place stank like a whaling station in
the hot weather, it was Mr. Holliday who
guessed the cause, and who broke open
the lockers until the source of the stench
was located, and who discovered the
miscreants, and who (in accordance with
Mr. Laxton's new methods of punishment)
caned them most satisfactorily—Dr. Pethwick,
his senior, had never caned a boy in
his life.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, when Mr. Holliday
observed that IVa was not progressing
rapidly with the experiment he had set them
to do, after explaining it to them, he
plunged boldly into the trouble, selecting,
as was his wont, one outstanding individual
for censure and, if necessary, punishment.
</p>

<p>
"What are you looking for, Williams?"
he asked, pleasantly.  "Trouble?"
</p>

<p>
Williams was a boy of much the same
type as Holliday himself (although
Mr. Holliday did not see the resemblance),
rather stocky, rather stupid, rather simple.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," said Williams.  "I'm just asking
Merivale if he's getting on all right."
</p>

<p>
"How nice of you to be so anxious about
Merivale," said Holliday.  "But I strongly
advise you to go back to your place and
get on with your experiment."
</p>

<p>
"I can't, sir, please, sir," said Williams.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Holliday.  "So your anxiety
about Merivale was not entirely disinterested?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Holliday had begun lately to realize
the value of sarcasm as a help in the
maintenance of discipline and was unconsciously
imperilling his popularity thereby.  Williams
merely stood still and resented
Mr. Holliday's remarks in silence.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," continued Holliday, "that
you did not pay attention when I was
explaining to you Gauss's method for
Determining the Moment of a Magnet.  But
the diagrams are still on the blackboard.
With the help of those you ought to be
able to make some progress.  I hope you
can, Williams, for your sake and especially
for the sake of what you sit on."
</p>

<p>
That was the sort of remark which ought
to have drawn a snigger from the rest of
the class; Mr. Holliday was quite surprised
when it did not come.  He looked round at
the faces turned towards him from the
laboratory benches, and in them he read
at last that he was not dealing with
naughtiness or indiscipline.  He came down
from his dais and approached the benches.
</p>

<p>
"Is anybody else in difficulty?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Yes, sir," came from different
parts of the laboratory.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's <i>your</i> trouble, then, Maskell?"
he went on.  Maskell was the clever
boy of the form.
</p>

<p>
"It's this compass needle, sir," said
Maskell.  "It doesn't seem to work."
</p>

<p>
Holliday bent over it.  He twisted the
little glass box around, and the needle spun
round idly.  When it came to rest it was
certainly not pointing to the north.  He
tapped the case.  The needle spun again,
and came to rest in a different position.
Clearly there was not a trace of magnetism
left in it.  He approached it to the bar
magnet lying on the sheet of paper on
which Maskell was conducting his experiment.
There was not the least quiver in
the needle at all.
</p>

<p>
"That's queer," said Holliday to himself.
</p>

<p>
"The magnet seems all wrong, too, sir,"
said Maskell.
</p>

<p>
Holliday slipped the magnet into the
paper stirrup which hung from the thread,
and allowed it to swing free.  As soon as
the rotation due to the extension of the
thread was finished, the magnet swung
idly, without a trace of the dignified
north-seeking beat which delighted Holliday's
heart even now, after observing it a
hundred thousand times.
</p>

<p>
He grabbed another bar magnet from
the bench, and brought its north pole
towards first the north and then the south
pole of the suspending magnet.  Nothing
happened.  He brought the two magnets
into contact—so still was the room that the
little metallic chink they made was heard
everywhere.  But neither bar magnet was
disturbed.  They were quite indifferent.  It
might have been two pieces of brass he was
bringing into contact, for all the attraction
that was displayed.
</p>

<p>
Holliday looked up from the bench; from
beneath his fair eyebrows he swept his
glance round the form.  In the expression
on the boys' faces he read interest,
indifference or amusement, according to their
varying temperaments, but no sign
whatever of guilt.
</p>

<p>
"Are <i>all</i> your magnets and compass needles
like this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the form.
</p>

<p>
Holliday went across to the cupboard and
took out the tray of bar magnets.  The ones
remaining there were in the same state—the
keepers joining north and south poles
betrayed no trace of adhesion.  He called
for the laboratory assistant.
</p>

<p>
"Owens!  Owens!"
</p>

<p>
Owens appeared from his den.
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice anything funny about
these magnets and compass needles when
you put them out?" demanded Holliday.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I thought they—"
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Holliday heard half of what he had to
say and then sent him off.  Clearly
Owens had no hand in the business, and
whatever had been done to the magnets
had been done before the lesson began.
He stood for a moment in thought.  But
now the IVa had got over the initial
interest and surprise, they seemed likely to
take advantage of the unusual state of
affairs.  They were already beginning to
fidget and wiggle and giggle and play—four
of the gravest crimes in Mr. Holliday's
calendar.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Holliday took a Napoleonic decision,
characteristically.  He swept away the
whole question of Determining the
Moment of a Magnet.  He called to Owens for
blocks of glass, and pins; he mounted his
dais, and wiped the blackboard clean of
Gauss's method.  Within two minutes the
subject of the lesson was changed to the
Determination of the Index of Refraction
of Glass, whereby there was no risk of
further trouble due to the mischievous
activities of naughty boys with the electro-magnetic
apparatus.  And, true to the disciplinary
standard which Mr. Holliday had
set himself the boys reaped nothing of
what they would term benefit, from
someone unknown's misdemeanour.
</p>

<p>
Although half an hour had been wasted,
in the remaining hour the class had
completed the experiment, thanks to Mr. Holliday's
shrewd driving of them.  No gap had
been made in the sacred syllabus—the
Determination of the Moment of a Magnet
could safely be left now until the old
magnets had been remagnetized.
</p>

<p>
When the class was finished Mr. Holliday
considered it his duty to go in and
report to his senior, Dr. Pethwick, upon the
latest misbehaviour of the boys.  But
Dr. Pethwick did not receive the news in a
sensible fashion—indeed, Holliday had no
hope that he would.  He was in the little
advanced physics laboratory, which had
gradually become his own owing to the
dearth of boys needing instruction in
advanced physics.
</p>

<p>
Later on Mr. Holliday made many and
desperate efforts to recall just what
apparatus there was upon the bench engaging
his attention when Holiday walked in, but
he never succeeded.  The big electrometer
was there, Holliday noticed, and there was
a lead from the power plug in the wall to
some simple make-and-break which was
buzzing cheerfully away surrounded by
various other instruments.
</p>

<p>
But of those other instruments Mr. Holliday,
later on, could only recall a vague
picture of a big red magnet and something
which might have been a glowing radio
valve or even a vacuum tube, so casual had
been Mr. Holliday's glance as a result of
the indignation which burned and seethed
within him.
</p>

<p>
"There's been trouble again in the junior
lab," said Mr. Holliday.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick merely turned his lean
white face towards him and did not hear him.
</p>

<p>
"Some of these young devils have demagnetized
every blessed magnet in the magnet
drawer," expanded Mr. Holliday.
</p>

<p>
That news certainly seemed to have
some effect upon Dr. Pethwick.  He switched
off the current so that the buzz of the
make-and-break stopped abruptly, and
came round the bench to Holliday.  His
hands flapped.  Mr. Holliday, recounting
the interview much later, described him as
looking like a new-caught fish flapping on
the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Every blessed one," said Holliday,
referring still to the magnets.  "And the
compass needles as well.  I bet it's Horne and
Hawkins and that crowd."
</p>

<p>
"D-do you think so?" quavered Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"It's two months since the last of their
silly practical jokes," fumed Holliday.
"They were just about due for another.  But
they've bitten off more than they can chew
this time.  I wouldn't have a bottom like
the one young Horne is going to have
tomorrow for something."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick's eyebrows rose.  Holliday
attributed the gesture to his own outspokenness
regarding young Ho4ne's bottom—no
one ever mentioned bottoms to
Dr. Pethwick—but he stood his ground stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"He's jolly well earned it," he said, "and
he's going to get what's coming to him."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick seemed more embarrassed
than ever.
</p>

<p>
"I—I shouldn't do anything about it
yet—" he began.  "Perhaps—"
</p>

<p>
"But I must," protested Holliday.  "These
things have to be jumped on at once.  Hard."
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Holliday attributed Dr. Pethwick's
hesitancy to fear of what Mr. Laxton
would say regarding yet another disciplinary
row on the Science side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't you worry," he went on, hotly.
"We won't have any song and dance about
it.  I'll have young Horne and Hawkins up
in my classroom this evening and get the
truth out of 'em.  I'll give 'em six each and
that will be the end of that."
</p>

<p>
"But—" said Dr. Pethwick.  "But—"
</p>

<p>
These un-Napoleonic "buts," this
dilatoriness, set a seal on Holliday's wrath.  He
issued a proclamation of independent
action.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," he said, "it happened in <i>my</i>
class, and it's <i>my</i> business to deal with it.
And I'm going to."
</p>

<p>
And with that he flung out of the
advanced physics laboratory, leaving
Dr. Pethwick bending over his experimental
bench with a worried look on his face.
Dr. Pethwick straightened his back, and eyed
his apparatus again.  He opened the door
leading through to the senior laboratory,
and looked at the cupboard which held the
drawer of bar magnets.  He noted its position.
</p>

<p>
Standing in the doorway he looked back
and forward, noting the relative positions
of his emitter, the magnet he was
experimenting with, and the magnet cupboard.
There could be no doubt now that the
Klein-Pethwick Diamagnetic Effect was
very marked and powerful.  It set him
wondering whether anywhere further along
that straight line—beyond the walls of the
school, perhaps, perhaps ten miles away—any
more magnets had lost their magnetism.
Then with a rush and a clatter Remove
B came pouring into the senior laboratory,
and Dr. Pethwick had to turn aside
and disconnect his apparatus in the
advanced laboratory.
</p>

<p>
The five minutes which he expended on
that were a golden time for Remove B.
Without supervision for that period they
played Old Harry throughout the senior
laboratory, with the result that by the time
Dr. Pethwick was ready to give them their
lesson they were well out of hand, and
that, combined with a certain abstractedness
on the part of Dr. Pethwick, led to the
lesson developing into a most delightful
exhibition of rowdyism.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Mr. Holliday was encountering
both ridicule and opposition,
which, such was his temperament, only
served to confirm him in his opinion.  Up in
the common-room the staff went to no
pains to conceal their amusement at hearing
that he had had a lesson spoilt by the
machinations of Horne and Hawkins and
their followers.
</p>

<p>
"I never knew a science class yet where
discipline was maintained," said Stowe,
who taught classics.
</p>

<p>
Holliday could only glower at him; the
statement was too idiotic even to contradict.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," added Malpas, the Modern
Languages master, "don't you remember the
great fish joke?  That was a rare one."
</p>

<p>
"They got all that was due to them, all
the same," said Holliday, taking the
offensive against his better judgement.
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Malpas, lunging neatly for
the opening.  "It doesn't seem to have done
much good, all the same, judging by this
new development."
</p>

<p>
"If I were better supported—" glowered
Holliday, and Malpas and Stowe tittered
gently.
</p>

<p>
"Discipline is a one-man job," said
Malpas solemnly, quoting words used by the
Head on a previous occasion.  Holliday was
a simply ideal man to rag.
</p>

<p>
"But look here, Holliday," said Dutton,
who taught Chemistry.  "D'you mean to
say they quite demagnetized about thirty
bar magnets, and compass needles as
well?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," snarled Holliday.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Dutton, "I'm only a
chemist, and I'm not very up to date, and I
came down from Cambridge a good long
time before some of you younger men, but
I always understood it was jolly difficult to
demagnetize iron <i>completely</i>.  There ought
to have been enough left for IVb to get
some sort of result, surely."
</p>

<p>
Dutton was only partly attempting to
annoy Holliday; he was really interested
in the point he had raised.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't put anything past Horne and
Hawkins," interposed Malpas, who knew
nothing about the subject at all.
</p>

<p>
"But what about the compass needles?"
said Dutton.  "If you take a bar magnet and
chuck it about a lot I suppose you can
weaken it nearly to zero, but it would
puzzle <i>me</i> to demagnetize a compass needle in
a brass case without damaging the case."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you don't know our young scientists,"
said Malpas, airily.  "They better
their instruction.  Young Hawkins is an
inventive genius, you know, and he's
blossomed out under Holliday's parental care.
Don't you remember the Aeolian harp?  I
bet <i>you</i> do, Summers."
</p>

<p>
Summers was the geography master.  In
their last rag before the celebrated
rotten-fish joke Horne and Hawkins had profited
by Holliday's instruction in Elementary
Sound to construct an Aeolian harp and
had hung it out of the window just before
Summers came in to teach them; during
the subsequent hour the wild fitful music
called forth by the wind had pervaded the
room in a weird and ghostly fashion, driving
Summers nearly to distraction.  He had
turned out every boy's desk and pockets
seeking for the source of the noise; he had
even (led on by the tactful suggestions of
the form humorists) sent a message to the
music room before he had succeeded in
solving the mystery.
</p>

<p>
Everyone laughed at the recollection, and
Summers had to defend himself.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," he said, heatedly, "I had them
nailed down within the hour, and they've
never forgotten it, either.  They haven't
tried any practical jokes on <i>me</i> twice."
</p>

<p>
That is the way the history of the world
is built up.  Malpas's reference to a
schoolboy's Aeolian harp, and Summers' hot
rejoinder on the subject sufficed both to
distract Holliday's attention from Dutton's
very relevant suggestion and to raise his
temper to such a pitch that he forgot all
about it until it was too late.  Otherwise
Holliday might easily have followed up the
idea, and guessed at Dr. Pethwick's
responsibility in the matter, and the history of
the world might have been different.
</p>

<p>
As it was, Holliday remained filled with
righteous indignation all afternoon, and,
having sent for Horne and Hawkins after
afternoon school, abruptly charged them
with a crime entirely absent from their
calendar, extensive though it was.  Even the
ready wits of these two young gentlemen
failed them when they found themselves
confronted with an accusation of demagetizing.
</p>

<p>
They had come prepared to refute
charges of brewing sulphuretted hydrogen
in the class-room inkwells and of tying up
the school bell-rope the week before so that
the porter had to find a ladder before
ringing the bell (so that the school
happily missed five minutes of lessons) and of
those two crimes they were only guilty of
one.  But this demagnetizing business beat
them.  They stuttered and stammered, and
their innocence compared badly with the
virtuous indignation they would have
assumed to perfection if they had been guilty.
</p>

<p>
Holliday, firmly convinced from the start
of their guilt, was raised to a pitch of
positive certainty by their blundering denials.
He fell upon them in the end and beat
them with all the shrewd application of
strength and perfection of timing to be
expected of a man who had only just missed
his cricket Blue.  It did him a world of
good, and it is to be hoped that it did
Horne and Hawkins a world of good, too.
</p>

<p>
The trouble was that when he boasted of
the deed to Dr. Pethwick the latter was
intensely embarrassed about it.  No man as
shy as he was could face all the commotion
and explanations and fuss and bother
consequent upon owning up to an act for which
two schoolboys had been caned.  Dr. Pethwick
shrank with horror from the thought
of the common-room remarks, and
Mr. Laxton's clumsy comments, and the
apologies which would have to be tendered to
Horne and Hawkins.  And, as a man of
retiring disposition will do, he readily found
reasons and excuses for not assuming the
responsibility.  He wanted to investigate
the Klein-Pethwick Effect a little more
closely before publishing his results.
</p>

<p>
He did not want publicity.  The modest
columns of the Philosophical Transactions
were good enough for him.  He knew that
the Fellowship of the Royal Society was a
certainty now.  He knew that Einstein and
Eddington would be pleased and congratulatory
because the mere demonstration of
the existence of the Klein-Pethwick Effect
was a substantial confirmation of the
Theory of Relativity, and additional
mathematical investigation might be enormously
important.  He decided that as the summer
holidays were not far off he would
keep his secret until then.  And thereby he
brought catastrophe a little nearer.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Dr. Edward Pethwick was in the
seventh heaven of delight.  He had
encountered Miss Dorothy Laxton
as he was walking home from school, and
she was not merely walking in a direction
which would take her past his house, but
she actually decided to walk along with
him, and she was talking to him with all
the intelligence and sincerity with which
he credited her.
</p>

<p>
It was two years now since she had come
down from Somerville, and yet she had not
lost the desperate earnestness of young
Oxford.  Disarmament was the subject she
chose to discuss with Dr. Pethwick—at
least, she would have called it a discussion,
but, as anyone might have expected who
knew them both, it was not so much a
discussion as an expression of Miss Laxton's
own views and opinions while Dr. Pethwick
supplied the conjunctions.
</p>

<p>
"The crucial point," said Dorothy, "is
that the great majority of people really
<i>don't</i> want armaments."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing," said Dorothy, "supposing
you could take a free referendum throughout
Europe—throughout the world if you
like.  Supposing the issue was—on the one
side, to go on as we are, and on the other
side, no armies, no navies, no anything like
that at all.  Which do you think would win?"
</p>

<p>
"Which do <i>you</i> think?" asked Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the peace party," said Dorothy.  "Oh,
I'm sure of it.  After all, who wants these
things?  People with shares in armament
firms, I suppose.  And people who want to
get their nephews into good jobs.  Yes, and
the idiots who think fighting's good for
people.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"M'm," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it make you furious to think
about it all?" asked Dorothy.  "The whole
wicked business has started again, just as
it did before the last war—you know, the
war to end war.  There's competition in
armaments again, and everyone knows
where that leads to.  If there's an army
there must be a staff.  And if there's a staff
it must make plans to fight someone—that's
its job.  And every staff must try to
find out what the other staff's plans are.
And those plans are going to leak out sooner
or later.  Then there's bad blood, and
more plans, and more competition, and
people get used to the idea of another war
coming so that when it begins there's no
real attempt made to stop it.
</p>

<p>
"It's the mere fact of the existence of
armaments which makes war possible, in
other words.
</p>

<p>
"And that general who came down to
inspect the Corps last week was talking to
Father at dinner about 'our enemies at
Geneva!'  I wanted to butt in, but—after
all he was our guest, and you know what
Father is like."
</p>

<p>
Again their eyes met, and there was a
little significant silence between them.
Pethwick had no difficulty in realizing that
Mr. Laxton held the strongest views in
opposition to his daughter's.  And although
they did not unite in condemning him
openly, there was a feeling of union
somewhere.  They felt closer together after that,
as though they were sharing a secret.  Pethwick
boiled with secret happiness, and
even Dorothy felt an inward comfort.
</p>

<p>
"And think what they could do if there
weren't wars, and armies, and navies and
so on.  Do you know, that with the money
spent in England on armaments, and on
paying for the last war, we could send
every single man and woman to a University
until they were twenty-one, feed them,
and clothe them and educate them?  <i>Really</i>
educate them.  Think what that would
mean to the world!"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick could only lift an eyebrow
at this statement.  He could not even say "M'm."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," added Dorothy hurriedly,
"you'd never persuade people to submit to
the amount of taxation they pay now for
armaments to pay for education.  They'd
never do it.  But you could do a lot, all the
same—clear the slums, and start productive
works, and give everyone with talent
a chance of better education, anyway.
Couldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's hot brown eyes caught Pethwick's
mild grey ones, and held them.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you?" persisted Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick would have gone on from
there to say how a short time ago he had
been interrupted in an important calculation
by all the tomfoolery of a review of
the Officers' Training Corps under his
windows, and he could have drawn a neat
parable from the story, if only Dorothy
had allowed him to get a single word in
edgeways.
</p>

<p>
"And that's only one side of the question,"
said Dorothy.  "That's without
discussing what another war would be like.
There are new weapons, and new poisons,
and all the other horrors we can hardly
bear to think of.  Why, do you know,
people's minds are so wrapped up in the
subject that that even now if there's a new
invention the first thought of everyone is
how it could be applied in war?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick gave a guilty start at that.
He realized that despite his own vaguely
pacific views he had devoted a good deal of
thought—quite unconsciously, if the
expression can be allowed—as to what
difference the Klein-Pethwick Effect would
make in a modern battle.  He was startled.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact—" he began, slowly.
But Dr. Pethwick was not destined to finish
that speech for some time to come.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
They had reached the corner of Launceton
Avenue; they were at the front gate
of No. 41, where Dr. Pethwick lived.  There
was someone sitting on the doorstep,
leaning back against the angle of the door and
the wall.  Dorothy, at Pethwick's side, drew
a sharp, hissing breath.
</p>

<p>
It was Mary Pethwick.  Her hat hung
precariously on the back of her head, and
her clothes were daubed with mud.  But it
was not the condition of her dress which
first caught the eye.  It was her face.  There
was mud and there was blood on her face,
and it was swollen and puffy and bruised
where the flesh could be seen through the
mask of blood and mud.  The first impression
was one of terrible damage after a severe
accident.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Dorothy.  She ran up the path
and bent over Mary, Pethwick hurrying
after her.
</p>

<p>
"'Sall right," said Mary, lifting the
hideous face, and leering at Dorothy through
her swollen eyelids.  "Norring marrer me.
Lirrelassdent.  'S all."
</p>

<p>
The providence that looks after drunken
people had guided Mary's reeling steps to
41, Launceton Avenue quite correctly.
</p>

<p>
Probably policemen had eyed her sharply
as she had staggered along the pavements,
but had forborne to arrest a respectably
dressed woman.  But once inside the gate
her mazy determination had deserted
her—Pethwick knew how it did.  She had
fallen down the path.  She had fallen at the
doorstep.  She had bumped her face on the
door-handle, and on the step.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick could see the key lying there,
and drops of blood, and the smear on the
knob—a scientist's powers of observation
are trained like a detective's.  Dazed and
silly, she had turned away from the door
and fallen again in the muddy flower-bed
below the front window.  After that, with
one last effort of the clouded mind, she had
pulled herself into the sitting position on
the doorstep in which they had found her.
And she was still quite ready to deny that
there was anything the matter with her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you poor thing!" said Dorothy,
bending over her.
</p>

<p>
"'S all right, I tell you.  'M all righ'.
Assdent."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy looked around at Pethwick.  His
face was grey.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take her in," he said quietly.  "You'll
be late for your meeting."
</p>

<p>
He reached past her, without meeting
her eyes, to open the door.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want a doctor?" asked Dorothy.
She still thought that Mary had at
least been run over, and she had never seen
a drunken woman before.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Pethwick slowly.  "I don't
think a doctor is necessary.  I'll look after
her."
</p>

<p>
He stooped to lift Mary's swollen body
from the doorstep, and while he was doing
so a sudden rush of realization came to
Dorothy.  She remembered all she had
heard whispered about Mary Pethwick in
scholastic tea-parties.  "You know, my
dear," a schoolmaster's wife would whisper
to a schoolmaster's cousin, "she <i>drinks</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy remembered that at times
Mrs. Pethwick had acted queerly when she met
her—her speech had been uncertain and
ill-connected, and her gait hesitating.  Up
to that moment Dorothy had, very wisely,
discounted the evidence of gossip, and she
had distrusted the evidence of her own
ears and eyes.  But here was the thing
proved to her.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick had put his long thin arms
round his wife's body, and was half carrying
her, half dragging her into the hall, his
long frail body bending under the strain.
Dorothy took her round the knees and
lifted her weight off the floor—Dorothy's
compact, well-trained physique was far
better adapted to carrying weights than
Pethwick's gangling figure.  Between them
they got her up the stairs and laid her on
the bed in the littered bedroom.  Examining
the bruised face with a more dispassionate
eye, Dorothy could see now that
the damage was superficial.
</p>

<p>
"Bring me some warm water," she said,
"and a flannel, and a basin.  I'll look after
her."
</p>

<p>
By the time Pethwick came up again
Dorothy had been busy.  She had taken off
the muddy dress and shoes, and tucked
Mary up in bed.  Resolutely she had kept
herself from shuddering at what she
noticed—Mary's horrid underclothes, and the
dingy sheets, and Pethwick's ragged
pyjamas which she had tucked away under
his pillow.
</p>

<p>
She took the basin from Pethwick's
trembling hands, felt the temperature of
the water, soaked the flannel, and began
to sponge away the dirt and blood from
Mary's face.
</p>

<p>
"'Oo d'you fink <i>you</i> are?" said Mary
suddenly.  "Chuck it.  You're 'urting."
</p>

<p>
When Mary was sober she generally
managed to gloss over to a small extent the
rasping Cockney dialect of her childhood,
but when she was drunk it was more
apparent than ever.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's got to be done," said
Dorothy, gently.
</p>

<p>
With one hand she held Mary's feeble
two; Mary's head rested in the crook of
her arm, and with her other hand she
went on sponging.
</p>

<p>
There had been occasions before when
she had dressed the hurts of her six-year
younger brother.
</p>

<p>
"Assident," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
The mud and the blood were wiped away.
Beneath them Dorothy found three small
cuts and a big bruise—a black eye.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, I think," said Dorothy,
trying to examine these coolly.
</p>

<p>
"'Sall right.  Lemme lone."
</p>

<p>
The torpor of drink was fast engulfing
Mary.  The bruised head turned on Dorothy's
arm and drooped towards the pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Give me the towel," ordered Dorothy,
"and you can take those things away."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick, waiting down in the little
hall, heard Dorothy's step above as she
gave a few last touches to the bedroom.
He heard Mary's cracked voice sing a
couple of bars of a song, tuneless and
mirthless, before it trailed away into
silence.  Then the door shut and Dorothy
came down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
The doors were all open in the hall.
Dorothy could see the disordered sitting-room
and kitchen, all the filth and evidence
of neglect.  There ran through her
mind a memory of what her father had
said—"a very brilliant young mathematician."  And
he stood there at the foot of
the stairs, and the working of his face
revealed the torment within him.  He was
clasping and unclasping his hands, and
even in that light and at that moment
Dorothy noticed their slender beauty.
</p>

<p>
She was sick with unhappiness at the
fate which had overtaken him, and it was
revealed to her what horrors he had been
through uncomplainingly.  And she had
always liked him, and now she more than
liked him.  She put out her hands toward
his beautiful ones.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, as weakness overtook
her.  She swayed for a moment holding
his hands before she came forward on to
his breast.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy had been kissed at parties by
subalterns and graduates, and there had
once been a mad interval with a young
surgeon, but there had never been anything
like this.  She felt she wanted to give
and give.  She would tear herself to shreds
if only that would alleviate some of his unhappiness.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick kissed her forehead and her
cheek.  He did not feel himself worthy of
her lips.  It did not even occur to him to
venture on such a sacrilege.  He held her
hands.  He stooped, and with infinite
tenderness and reverence he kissed their cool
palms.  He was awestruck and humble, like
a knight in the presence of the Grail.  One
of the Lordly Ones had taken notice of his
existence, had tacitly given him leave to
worship at her feet where formerly he
had only worshipped from afar.  She smiled
as he bent before her, and touched his
thin fair hair, and his ears, and the nape
of his neck, so that he dared all, and
kissed her lips as she smiled, and entered
into Paradise.
</p>

<p>
Presently sanity came back to them in
some degree.
</p>

<p>
"What about your meeting?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I'm too late for that—anyway," she
whispered back, and she kissed him again,
and for a time sanity disappeared once
more, as it will sometimes even in the case
of Honours Graduates in History and
Doctors of Science.
</p>

<p>
It could not last long, for all that.
Pethwick was neither a bold enough lover nor
sufficiently experienced.  Soon they became
aware that they were kissing in a squalid
little house; that beside them was a kitchen
stacked with dirty dishes, and beside that
a sitting-room thick with dust and litter,
and that overhead there lay a drunken
woman whose snores were penetrating the
bedroom door and drifting down the stairs
to them, so that they fell apart a little
self-consciously.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick's fingers twittered.  He wanted
to shut that kitchen door and shut out all
sight of that muddle, but he could not do
it unobtrusively.  Dorothy saw the gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Were <i>you</i> going to clear up?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick nodded, shamefaced.  He did
not mind how much he did for his wife,
but he came from a stratum of society
wherein there is something to be ashamed
of in the admission that a man may do
housework.
</p>

<p>
"I'll help you," said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
That was how they got over their
self-consciousness.  Amid the boiling of kettles,
and clattering of dishes, while Dorothy,
bare-armed, worked with scourer and mop,
and Pethwick wiped and put away, there
was no room for false modesty.  They were
friends again as well as sweethearts by
the time washing up was finished, and they
were both happily conscious of it, too.
</p>

<p>
When it was all finished Dorothy looked
at her wrist-watch as she replaced it.
</p>

<p>
"I really ought to be going," she said.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick nodded.  His experience of life
so far had not given him any illusions
that Paradise might continue forever.
Dorothy might have added, "I don't want to,"
to her statement that she must be going,
but she did not.  She could only look like
it, and Pethwick with bowed head missed
the expression on her face.  When he
looked up again she was pulling on her
gloves.
</p>

<p>
A scientist may be an unsatisfactory
lover.  His training may lead him to deduce
from a gesture of that sort, the intention
of immediate departure.  He led the way
back through the hall to the front door.
The manners he had to acquire caused
him to open the door, which was a pity,
because that meant their farewell could
be seen from the street and must therefore
be restrained.  Yet Dorothy put both
her hands in his to say good-bye.  The
fading evening light lit up his mild, kindly
face.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," said Dorothy, and then,
after a second's pause, "You <i>dear</i>."
</p>

<p>
With that she was gone, hurrying out
to the gate and along the pavement, lest
he should see the tears which had come
to her eyes at the thought of the sorrow
he had borne and still would bear, uncomplainingly.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick stood long at the door staring
after her, long after she was out of sight,
and he turned away at length back into
an everyday world which was somehow
all misty with happiness.  And while the
human, ordinary part of him was musing
shyly over this amazing occurrence, the
incorrigible mathematical part had picked
up the thread of those Klein-Pethwick
calculations once more, and was evolving
more and more surprising results.
</p>

<p>
Presumably that was how in Pethwick's
mind his love for Dorothy and his
researches into electro-magnetics became so
intertwined that he could never think
about the one without the other; and that,
quite probably, is the germ of the
subsequent development whereby in Pethwick's
mind the employment of the Klein-Pethwick
Effect to solve problems of disarmament
was so seriously considered.  The
stage of the world was being set for the
tragedy.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
It was in this fashion that Dorothy
Laxton and Edward Pethwick became
sweethearts.  They never were, in all their
short period of happiness, any more than
that.  Seeing that it was only for a few
weeks that their happiness endured they
never came to know the strain that such
happiness brings with it.
</p>

<p>
They could chatter together unendingly.
Pethwick was the kind of man who has to
learn what love is—the love that takes a
man by the throat and rouses the instincts
of Neanderthal man even in the bosom of
a professor of mathematics.  He learnt
that too late; his love affair did not last
long enough.  He was too unsure of himself,
his love for Dorothy was too selfless,
quite apart from the fact that circumstances
were too strongly against them.
</p>

<p>
It took a long period of chatter about
disarmament or housing reform to rouse
him to the pitch of wanting to kiss
Dorothy—or rather of realizing that he wanted
to—and when he did want to he rarely
could.  A headmaster's daughter and an
assistant schoolmaster are surrounded by
spies, voluntary and involuntary.  There
are hundreds, thousands, of people who
know them by sight and are willing to
talk about them; and Pethwick and
Dorothy were loftily above setting themselves
to deceive the world.  Rather than that
they submitted to having nothing to
deceive the world about.
</p>

<p>
Besides, the talk in which they indulged
was exciting, pleasurable in itself.  While
they were coming to know each other
Dorothy could pour out to Pethwick all the
ideas which had fermented in her mind
during the two years she had been
housekeeping for her father.  Two years of
housekeeping (Dorothy had agreed about that
when she came down from Somerville)
should be part of every woman's training,
even when she is an Honours Graduate in
History, but they can be deadly dull.  They
can be made duller still by the additional
duties attendant upon doing the honours
of a secondary school headmaster's household,
especially when one's mind is choc-a-bloc
with ideas about how the world
should be reformed—ideas which are
consistently scouted by one's father and one's
young brother, and are simply horrifying
("My dear, that sounds like <i>socialism</i>") to
the wives of the Staff.
</p>

<p>
All the Staff had wives who thought
(presumably Laxton chose Staff who would
marry that sort of wife) that poor people
preferred drawing unemployment pay to
doing work, and preferred slums to good
houses, and did not mind their babies
dying, and ought to contribute to the cost
of a war fought when they were children,
and who thought there was something
underhand about co-operation, and
something undignified about the League of
Nations, and something impossible about
disarmament, and who were so generally
uncreative that Dorothy's blood boiled
whenever she had anything to do with them.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick was different.  He was a man
who <i>did</i> things—even though the things
he did were quite unintelligible to her.  He
had the open mind of a scientist, and he
had a first-hand knowledge of working-class
life which Dorothy was glad to draw
upon for information.  Pethwick had no
prejudices.  Pethwick's mind was not
hide-bound.  If his pacifism had been merely
quiescent and not rabid up to this time
it was because his interest had been
concentrated on other creative ideas.  As it
was, her notions fell on fertile soil.  He
caught her enthusiasms rapidly, and they
would agree with each other until they
were quite intoxicated with each other's
good sense and the world seemed a brighter
happier place even though they had not
yet remoulded it save in conversation.
</p>

<p>
It was quite early in their new friendship
that Dorothy heard of the Klein-Pethwick
Effect.  Oddly enough—it is thus
that the history of the world is built
up—it was a discussion regarding corporal
punishment which brought the matter
into conversation.  Dorothy adduced as
part of her argument Mr. Holliday's
boastings (recounted by Mrs. Holliday) about
how he had brought Horne and Hawkins
to reason.  She checked herself when she
saw the queer guilty look on Pethwick's
face.  For a moment she was tormented
with the idea that she had hurt his feelings
by this thoughtless allusion to the
lack of discipline on the Science Side.  But
it was not that at all.
</p>

<p>
"You know," began Pethwick doubtfully,
"it was my fault that those boys were
beaten."
</p>

<p>
Somehow Dorothy's views on corporal
punishment altered a little at that.  If it
were Pethwick's' doing, then something
might be said in favor of corporal
punishment—that was how she felt, even if it
were not how she thought.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you wanted Mr. Holliday
to—" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No!" said Dr. Pethwick hotly.  "No.
They didn't deserve it.  I didn't want him
to cane them.  I—I ought to have stopped
him."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Dorothy, softly.
</p>

<p>
"It—it was I who did the thing Holliday
was so annoyed about, not Horne and
Hawkins."
</p>

<p>
"You?" said Dorothy, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick, and he began to
make her the first announcement of his
discovery, rather shyly, and with a
difficulty regarding his words.  He was
actuated by the same motives as caused an
Elizabethan adventurer to pour the riches
of the Spanish Main at his lady's feet, or
a Dyak head-hunter to present to his
betrothed the fruits of his latest war-making
expedition.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Pethwick, "I was
carrying out a series of experiments in the
advanced lab.  I wanted to confirm some
calculations of mine, based on some
suggestions Klein put forward last year.  You
see, I've made a discovery."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>good</i>," said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather interesting," went on
Pethwick, "because—"
</p>

<p>
"Because?"
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick found himself confronted
with the necessity of explaining the
most recent development of modern
physics to an Honours Graduate in History, to
whom the name of Relativity meant no
more than that name, and whose knowledge
of electricity was limited to the ability
to change a blown fuse-wire.  He evaded
the difficulty as far as he could.
</p>

<p>
"Theoretically it's very important," he
said, "at least I think so.  We'll soon know
what the people who really matter think
about it.  It's one side—one facet, you
might say—of a confirmation of the Theory
of Relativity.  There are various deductions
which may be made from it, I think.
It throws rather an interesting light on
various hypotheses.  But practically it boils
down to a contra-magnetic effect—that is
the only word I can think of—exerted over
a field extending to a considerable
distance from the emitter—I don't know even
now quite how far."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" said Dorothy.  For a moment she
pretended to understand, until her good
sense got the better of her.  Then she went
on—"I don't know what you mean.  Don't
forget I never studied physics.  Could you
say it again, differently?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's this way.  By using quite a
simple sort of emitter I can create a
curious contra-magnetic effect for some
distance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a sort of ray?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy found that rather thrilling.  She
had read of death rays in the thrillers she
sometimes condescended to read.
</p>

<p>
"No, <i>not</i> a ray," said Pethwick with
asperity.  Then he softened.  "Well, I
suppose the lay public would call it a ray.
That's what the newspapers would say.
But all I can say is it's an Effect—the wave
hypothesis is in a state of flux just now,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"But what is this Effect?  What does it do?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I told you.  It's contra-magnetic—very
strongly so indeed."
</p>

<p>
"But—but—I'm sorry to be so ignorant,
but what is a contra-magnetic effect, please?"
</p>

<p>
"In this case it means that any magnets
in that field lose their magnetism.
Permanently, in the case of permanent magnets.
Magnetism cannot exist in that field.  I
fancy—"
</p>

<p>
Pethwick had to check himself.  It was
impossible to go on with the simplest of
his hypothetical explanations of the
phenomenon to someone ignorant of scientific
terminology.  And it was obvious that
Dorothy had not realized the practical
implications of what he had just said.  He
pulled himself together.  He tried to make
himself imagine that he was not addressing
a Lordly One, but some inky third-form boy.
</p>

<p>
"There might be quite important
consequences, you know," he said.  "For
instance—  You drive a motor-car, don't you?
In that motor-car is a magnet."
</p>

<p>
"Is there?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was one of those people who
drive brilliantly and can execute all
running repairs and still not realize that a
motor-car is driven by the repeated
explosion of mixtures of combustible gas and
air ignited by an electric spark.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course there is.  The dynamo—the
magneto, in other words—is just a
permanent magnet with a coil of wire
rotating in its field.  The self-starter is
a coil of wire and an electro-magnet.  Well,
if while you are driving your car you come
into this contra-magnetic effect—"
</p>

<p>
"The magnet would go on strike and I
should stop."
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  And you wouldn't be able to go
on again until you had bought yourself a
new magneto and put it in in place of the
old one."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Dorothy.  "Now I see."
</p>

<p>
She was very much impressed.
</p>

<p>
"The permanent magnet and the electro-magnet,"
went on Pethwick, trying to
talk with the eloquence of those popular
handbooks on science which he detested,
"occupy a very important position in our
economy.  There's hardly a piece of
apparatus in which they don't play a part.
Trams, buses, motor-cars, trains,
telephones, aeroplanes, generating stations,
transformers, railway signals, not one could
function without the aid of magnetism.
We owe all our modern civilization to
Faraday, in other words."
</p>

<p>
"And now <i>you</i> know," said Dorothy, "how
to put the clock back to before Faraday's
time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick simply, and they
were both of them silent for a while.  Then
Pethwick began again, uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he said, "looked at in that
light, the possibilities are all destructive,
not constructive.  But it isn't so.  And I
didn't intend it that way when I began
the calculations.  It helps electro-magnetic
theory on enormously, I fancy.  It—"
</p>

<p>
He was up again against the blank wall
of Dorothy's ignorance of physics.  There
was only this one aspect of the discovery
which she could appreciate.
</p>

<p>
"You remember once saying something
to me about the application of new
inventions in war?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"When you said that, even I had been
thinking about—this."
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
"You could stop aeroplanes?" said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, I think so.  It wouldn't be
very easy of course.  About as difficult as
catching an aeroplane in the beam of a
searchlight.  But it could be done with a
fair amount of certainty."
</p>

<p>
"So that bombing raids could be stopped?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I thought of that.  And you could
put submarines out of action under water.
And tanks would be no use.  And in
favorable conditions you could hold up the
motor transport of an army.  And make
ships' compasses useless—unless by chance
they were gyroscopic.  You could make war
impossible that way."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick looked at Dorothy anxiously
for approval.  But there the student of
science was up against the student of
history.  Just for a moment Dorothy agreed
with him.  Then she remembered some of
what she had read in that connection.
</p>

<p>
"No!" she said passionately.  "Don't you
believe that.  There is no invention which
can stop war in that way.  Every time a
new weapon has been discovered
mealy-mouthed people have said that it would
put an end to war.  Macauley makes the
suggestion somewhere.  Why, just after the
last war people said that the new weapons
would make war so horrible that there
would never be another.  But they're
talking about the next war now, aren't they?
Remember Bloch?  He predicted what the
last war would be like twenty years before
it happened, but he went on to say that
no country would be foolish enough to
fight if it meant fighting that sort of war.
But they did, all the same.  No, dear, you
can't stop war just by altering the rules
or the weapons."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Dorothy was quite out of breath as a
result of this long speech.  She had to
stop for a moment, while Pethwick blinked
at her sadly.  He had really thought that
a pacifist application of his invention was
possible, and he had been exalted at the
thought of the pleasure it would give her.
He could be logical enough with
mathematical formulae, but his brain was not
so ready in dealing with problems of
human nature.  But now that his ideas had
been guided in the right direction he
himself could follow up the deduction.
</p>

<p>
"No," he agreed unhappily.  "This
wouldn't stop war.  I see now.  If it ruled
out tanks and aeroplanes we should get
back to the old system of trench warfare
without any of the solutions of the
problem.  Then we should be worse off than
before, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick's keen mind was groping
among his limited general knowledge and
his memories of what he had read casually
about war.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," he went on, "there are
probably counter-measures which could be
taken.  I've explored some of the avenues
without finding one, but of course I have
hardly touched the subject.  There almost
for certain is some sort of screen which
could guard against the Effect.  If the
engine were protected things would go on
just as before.  And of course there is no
application of Diesel engines and steam
engines and so on.  They'd find a way out
of the difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"They would," agreed Dorothy bitterly.
"Every weapon has found its antidote
sooner or later.  Look at the race between
guns and armour."
</p>

<p>
"I ought to have thought of all this
before," said Pethwick, and his disappointment
was evident in his voice.
</p>

<p>
With that, remorse tore at Dorothy's
vitals.  She had allowed herself to be run
away with her hobby.  She was crabbing
her lover's invention just because it could
not put an end to war.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear," she said.  "Don't be so
unhappy about it.  I should have had more
sense.  You've made a wonderful discovery,
and here I am not saying how pleased I
am about it.  Because I <i>am</i> pleased.  It's
the best news I've ever heard."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at Pethwick striding along
on his gangling legs beside her.  There was
a look in her eyes which gave Pethwick
as much pleasure as the thought of
Einstein's congratulations.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy in the old days, before she had
a sweetheart, had told herself that in her
relations between her and her man she
would never display the blind self-abnegation
of the woman of the previous generation—she
would never knuckle under the
way her own mother, for instance, had
knuckled under to her father.  She was
quite sure that any respect would be mutual.
</p>

<p>
But in this case it was not so easy.  She
was utterly ignorant of science.  She had
to take so much on trust.  The one thing
she was sure of was that if Pethwick said
that his discovery was important it was
very important indeed—epoch-making,
perhaps.  She was most profoundly
impressed, for she had all the exaggerated
respect for scientific discovery which
characterizes the layman.  And she was very
glad, vaguely, that she had this feeling
of Pethwick's superiority over her.
</p>

<p>
"Are you publishing your results?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Y-yes," said Pethwick.  "I ought to do
so at once, of course.  But I thought—"
</p>

<p>
His embarrassment was obvious.  Dorothy
found herself making tactful noises,
and was slightly surprised thereat.
</p>

<p>
"You see," plunged Pethwick, "after
Holliday had caned Horne and Hawkins
there'd be such a fuss if it all came out
now that I was the one who had really
done what they were beaten for.  There'd
be so many explanations.  I thought I'd
wait a little while, until the summer
holidays began."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy, to her eternal credit, grasped
the implication without smiling.  If her
lover should choose to postpone the
attainment of world-wide fame in order to avoid
a few common-room explanations and
formalities, she could not possibly interfere.
A man who rated comfort so far above
celebrity was unique in her circle of
acquaintances.  And there was another aspect
of the matter—
</p>

<p>
"So am I the only person you've told?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick.  "You're the only one."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy told herself she was a fool to
feel so absurdly pleased about that, but
the tone she used was not a very convincing
one.  Then a new fear gripped her.
</p>

<p>
"But supposing someone else makes the
same discovery?" she said.  "Supposing
while you're waiting—  Somebody else
might get all the credit."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it matters," said Pethwick,
"who it is that first discovers a
thing, as long as somebody does.  The
personal element isn't really important in
science, is it?  It's only the progress that
counts."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick enunciated the simple selfless
creed of the scientist without any <i>arrière-pensée</i>
at all.  He meant just what he said.
Dorothy found herself gaping at this sublime
simplicity.  She decided that scientists
had a good deal in common with the very
early Christian Fathers.  And more than
that; she felt herself overflowing with
tenderness towards him just on account
of this very simplicity.  For a moment she
put a hand on his arm, despite the fact
that they were in a public street in the
presence of a thousand potential spies.
</p>

<p>
"But I'd like you to get the credit," she
said, reproachfully.  "You deserve it.  You're
just the sort of man—"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy reined herself in; she felt, despite
her intelligent lack of superstition,
that she was speaking words of ill omen.
The remainder of her sentence, if she had
finished it, would have been—"who does
the work and never gets the credit for it."  She
realized at that instant that her words
were truer than she had thought.  She
vowed to herself then and there that if
ever there was a controversy as to who
was entitled to fame on this account she
would fight tooth and nail for Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
Even Pethwick could not help noticing
the anxiety in her face.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think anyone else is likely to
make the discovery," he said.  "It's some
time since Klein published his calculations,
and he died last year.  And Norbury,
who's been working on those lines since
then, doesn't seem to have made any progress.
You see, you couldn't call it a <i>simple</i>
piece of mathematics.  It—it's very
involved, in fact.  Klein himself, who had a
very great mathematical brain indeed,
didn't see where he was aiming at.  In
fact he was aiming at something quite
different at the time of his death.  He'd
missed one of the implications of his formulae.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he would have realized
for a long time the possibility of this
development, if he did at all.  And Norbury's
rather—well, rather a charlatan as far as
mathematics are concerned.  None of the
people working along these lines now are
really capable of doing very much along
them.  As far as I know, of course."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy could only look at him and
smile.  The man grew more adorable with
every word he uttered.  "A very great
mathematical brain," forsooth, had "missed
one of the implications."  Yet Pethwick
had missed an implication, too—a simpler
one, to the effect that in that case his own
mathematical brain was greater still.  And
Norbury—one of the few scientific names
with which she was familiar and which
appeared in the newspapers—was—"well,
rather a charlatan."  Dorothy was perfectly
convinced he was if Pethwick could say
so so disarmingly.  Then Pethwick was a
greater man than the great Norbury—if
she had met Norbury at a dinner party six
months ago she would have been thrilled.
Well, she was thrilled now walking along
the street with Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
And with all that, this scientific part of
the business was by far the less important
half.  It was his simplicity she loved him
for—the modesty which forbade him from
seeing anything remarkable in his achievement
or in himself.  The man had no notion
that he was so astonishingly clever.  He was
as lovable as a child on that account.
Furthermore, he had solved what he couldn't
call a "a <i>simple</i> piece of mathematics."  In
this moment of insight Dorothy had a sudden
realization of what that involved—the
indefatigable patience, the iron resolution,
the undismayed perseverance, all the
qualities which demanded her admiration
and which one would hardly realize could
be possessed by a professor of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Yet for all this, there was something
Dorothy did not know about Pethwick.  She
did not know that he called her, to himself,
"a Lordly One."  She did not realize
yet that along with the simplicity and
modesty which she loved there existed a
chronic sense of inferiority.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Altogether, during the second
half of that summer term, there
were eight occasions when Doctor
Edward Pethwick met Miss Dorothy Laxton
for conversation without a third person
being present.  No. 1 was the occasion when
Mrs. Pethwick met with her accident on
the doorstep—the time when Dorothy's
pity roused her to a rather unwomanly
forwardness which precipitated the whole
affair.  It must have been at interview
No. 3 that Dorothy heard first about the
Klein-Pethwick Effect.  At interviews Nos. 4, 5
and 6 their relationship tended to round
itself off; raw edges were smoothed away.
</p>

<p>
It was not specially odd that they were
happy without physical endearments and
caresses.  Neither of them was accustomed
to them.  It is possible that if Pethwick
had not been a married man they might
have gone through interviews 2-6 just the
same without kissing or even thinking of
kisses.  The strong emotional stress which
had stirred them on the first occasion was
wanting.  Dorothy was a healthy young
woman, but it called for something rather
unusual to break down her reserve.  And
she had her theories, too.  Despite—or
because of—her modernism she rated
intellectual companionship far above emotional
companionship; perhaps because she knew
much more about the former than about
the latter.  And since it was impossible for
them to indulge in caresses without a
certain amount of intrigue and scheming they
simply did without them, and did not
consciously notice the loss.
</p>

<p>
There was one other factor, too, which
contributed to Dorothy's state of mind.
She loathed Mary Pethwick with an
intense physical loathing; she thought with
disgust of her dirty clothing and drunken
habits.  She was not going to share
Pethwick with a woman like that.  So she was
content—happy, in fact—with the seven
casual meetings, a total of perhaps ten
hours spent in walking through suburban
streets, varied with two occasions when
they boldly drank coffee <i>coram publico</i> in
the confectioner's in the High Street.  In
these enlightened times no one, not even
wives of the Staff, nor parents, could find
anything wrong in a married man drinking
coffee with a young woman twice in
five weeks.
</p>

<p>
And they debated whether the Locarno
Treaty was a betrayal of the League of
Nations, and they discussed the crimes
committed in the name of liberty at
Versailles, and they tried to forecast the
future of Cooperation, and they tried to
outline a constructive housing policy; but
most of all they talked about the two
things which held first place in Dorothy's
attention—the Klein-Pethwick Effect and
Disarmament.
</p>

<p>
Ordinary people would say that Dorothy
had a bee in her bonnet about disarmament,
but perhaps it would be just as true,
or false, to say that Joan of Arc had a
bee in her bonnet about English invasions,
or Florence Nightingale about sick-nursing.
If Dorothy Laxton's exertions had disarmed
the world, set the world free from
the haunting fear of war and from the
burden of armaments, people nowadays
might think about her with the reverence
they extend to the other two women.
</p>

<p>
There might be statues erected to her
and essays written about her, and board
school children might have to listen to
one lesson a year about her life and work.
As it is, she can only be described
unsympathetically as a young woman with a bee
in her bonnet, or sympathetically as a
young woman of enthusiasms and convictions.
</p>

<p>
When seeking out the fundamental
causes of things, it can only be
concluded that the next step in this
disarmament business was taken by
Mr. Laxton, of all people—it goes without
saying that he did it quite unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
He did at breakfast-time.
</p>

<p>
"Have you called on all the married
staff this year?" he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
That was naturally—especially in
Mr. Laxton's opinion—one of the duties of
the daughter of a widowed headmaster.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly all," said Dorothy, shortly, and
prayed that the answer would suffice.
</p>

<p>
"Whom haven't you called on?" demanded
Mr. Laxton.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Summers—she's been away such
a lot nursing her mother—and—Mrs. Pethwick."
</p>

<p>
"You're going to call on Mrs. Pethwick,
of course?  There're only two weeks left
of this term, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really think I need?" said
Dorothy, forcing herself to speak
disinterestedly.  "She's different from the
others.  I don't believe she'd notice whether
I did or not, and—you know it's hateful
to go there."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton had been a general during
the war.  He fervently believed the army
doctrine that to get the best out of
your men you must know them personally—from
above, of course; a kind of
bird's-eye view.  The same rule must
necessarily apply to the womenfolk.  These
condescensions were a help to discipline.
</p>

<p>
"I know as much about Mrs. Pethwick
as you do.  Don't you see that because
she's different from the others makes all
the more reason why you should treat
her the same?  You're far more likely to
encourage her in her—failing if you treat
her like an outcast."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"Try and run in there during the next
day or two," concluded Mr. Laxton.
</p>

<p>
If Dorothy had not been Dr. Pethwick's
sweetheart she might have
continued to argue the matter; but as it was
she could only yield.  She was morbidly
anxious not to discuss Mrs. Pethwick—or
Doctor Pethwick, either—with other
people.
</p>

<p>
And that meant that she had to pay
the call.  Mr. Laxton had the memory for
detail which is so necessary in a
headmaster or a brigadier-general.  Dorothy
would not lie to him; one of her theories
was that most of the troubles of this
world are initiated or kept up by lies,
and he would be sure to ask, later, if she
had paid the call.  So that at four o'clock
on a hot Wednesday afternoon Dorothy
set herself to carry out the distasteful
task.  She wore her least obtrusive
costume and hat for some obscure reason or
other—perhaps because she wanted to
leave the minimum target for the
inevitable remarks which Mrs. Pethwick
would make afterwards.  Mrs. Pethwick
was always shabby and ill-brushed.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Dorothy came to 41, Launceton
Avenue—it was the first time she had
been nearer to it than the corner since
Mrs. Pethwick's "accident"—and knocked
at the door.  Naturally, inevitably, it was
Pethwick who opened the door.  She had
been so anxious that he should be out;
she hated the thought of having to talk
to the two of them together, but
presumably he had come home the moment
afternoon school was finished.  Still, she
would have to go through with it now.
</p>

<p>
"Is Mrs. Pethwick at home?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
It was a second or two before Pethwick
answered, and during that time she had
to look up at his face.  It was transfigured.
His pleasure at this unexpected encounter
was obvious.  He was like a child,
and the renewed realization of this sent
a pang through her despite the armour
plate of indifference she had so carefully
assumed.
</p>

<p>
"Mary's out at the moment," said Pethwick.
"But I'm expecting her any time
now.  Won't you come in?"
</p>

<p>
The subsequent history of the world
trembled in the balance as Dorothy
debated the matter within herself.  If she
came in she would have an excuse to cut
the interview shorter after Mrs. Pethwick's
return; if she went away she
would only have the whole blessed business
to go through again later on.  She
came in.  Pethwick offered her a chair in
the dingy sitting-room, and fluttered
round her.
</p>

<p>
For once in a way those two had nothing
to say to one another save banalities.
They were reduced to remarking how hot
it was, and how near the end of term
had come, just as if they really were an
assistant schoolmaster and his
headmaster's daughter.  There was
awkwardness between them, and Dorothy was
fully aware of the indifference to which
she was pretending.
</p>

<p>
"Mary often goes to her mother's in the
afternoon," said Pethwick, struggling to
force formality into his voice.  "But she's
nearly always home at tea-time.  I can't
think what's happened to her."
</p>

<p>
That was an unfortunate remark.  Both
of them had ideas about what may have
happened to her.  Pethwick struggled on
heroically.
</p>

<p>
"Let me get you some tea," he said.
"I'm sure you need it in this heat."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was past even the use of
monosyllables by now.  She could only
make noises.  Pethwick went out into the
kitchen; through the open door she
heard him fill the kettle and put it on
the gas stove, and then she heard
crockery rattle.  For a minute or two she
forced herself to sit still, but at last
restlessness overcame her and she wandered
out into the kitchen too.  Some of the
necessary tea-things were on a tray, and
now Pethwick, inclining his lean length
over the table, was laboriously trying to
cut wafer-thin bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me do that," she said impulsively,
and came up beside him to take
the knife and loaf from him.
</p>

<p>
Their hands touched, and Pethwick
was a man as well as a mathematician,
and Dorothy was a woman as well as a
pacifist.  Something exploded within
them.  Pethwick's arms went out to her
just as she came into them.  Dorothy
reacted wildly from her previous pose.
Emotion tore at both of them.  He
caught her against him.  Dorothy felt
the strength drain out of her legs, and
Pethwick swayed as her weight came
upon his arms.  Somehow they tottered
through the two doors into the sitting-room.
The big arm-chair was ugly, but
it received the two of them with
grandfatherly hospitality.  They kissed and
Dorothy's hat fell unregarded to the
floor.  There were tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
After five minutes the wild trembling
ended.  They had not mastered themselves,
but they could at least be to
some extent purposeful.  Dorothy swept
the hair from her eyes and could look
look at him, bending her head back
above his encircling arms.  With the
relaxation of inhibitions the question she
had so wanted to ask came leaping from
her lips without her volition.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," she said.  "You don't really
love her, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Pethwick.  "I haven't for years."
</p>

<p>
With that Dorothy kissed him again,
madly, but now that they had begun to
talk articulately kisses would not stop
Pethwick from uttering the thoughts which
came surging up in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"We must leave her," he said.  "We must
go away together."
</p>

<p>
Even at that moment Dorothy noticed
that his usual mild tenor was thick and
hoarse.  It gave her an insight into the
turmoil within him.
</p>

<p>
"You know what you are asking me?"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick, and now, too late,
he tried to return her kisses.  She
received them, but without the abandon of
two minutes ago.  And at the first opportunity
she went on with her questionings.
</p>

<p>
"Listen a moment, dear," she said.  "Tell
me, how much money have you got?"
</p>

<p>
Pethwick considered for a moment.
There was some sort of accumulated
balance at the bank; he would receive two
months' salary in a fortnight's time.
Perhaps he had two hundred pounds—but he
knew in that instant that two hundred
pounds was nothing in the present crisis.
Two hundred pounds a year in Consols was
about the least that Dorothy would
consider as "money" in this connection.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's only hope faded; for a brief
space she had been sustained by the
thought that by some miracle Pethwick
might have considerable savings.  She
tried to smile at him, and shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"You say 'Come away with me,'" she
said.  "What happens to a man who runs
away with his headmaster's daughter?
You'd lose your job."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Father would have to leave
too—it's quite possible, but it wouldn't
matter, as he'd never have me back again.
You'd never get another teaching job,
would you?  And you'd have to keep us
both—and—<i>her</i>."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick drooped a little with every
word she said, but she went on, hopefully
again, now.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
"What about other jobs?" she said.
"You're a distinguished scientist.  Is
there any professorship open to you?"
</p>

<p>
Pethwick shook his head.  He could not
conceive of himself pushing into any of
the possible posts; they went mostly to
people who wrote books and who had a
genius for self-advertisement, like Norbury.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing?" asked Dorothy, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"There's calculating," said Pethwick
desperately.  "At the Observatory—"
</p>

<p>
"Hack work?" demanded Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick could only agree.  He had heard
what sort of pay was given to mathematical
assistants—and he had heard,
too, how much competition there was for
that employment nowadays.
</p>

<p>
"That's not the sort of work for you,
dear," said Dorothy emphatically.  She had
an uncanny insight into the by-ways of
making a living in the sciences.
</p>

<p>
"You see, dear," went on Dorothy, "I
have to think for the two of us.  One of
us must be practical-minded at least."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy left it to be understood that
she was practical-minded; she honestly
thought she was.
</p>

<p>
"But when you publish your results,"
persisted Dorothy.  "When people get to
hear about the Klein-Pethwick Effect.
You'll be famous then, won't you?  You'll
be distinguished.  And then—  It won't be
more than a few months."
</p>

<p>
There is little need to follow that
conversation further.  Perhaps at that very
moment a hundred thousand other couples
were hoping for a happy consummation of
their affairs "in a few months' time" when
something or other should happen.
Dorothy had no realization of how many
people wait in similar circumstances and
she had no knowledge of how many people
wait in vain.  She thought their case was
unique.
</p>

<p>
But they were full of hope; they had
only just begun to wait, and they could
make their plans hopefully.  Dorothy was
quite sure that her father would be
reconciled to her marriage via the divorce court
if only Pethwick were famous enough and
rich enough—and she set her teeth and
swore she would not be broken-hearted if
her father never were reconciled.
</p>

<p>
And Pethwick was content to listen to
her.  He really knew nothing about the
practical details of life—he did not even
know the conditions that had to be fulfilled
before a divorce could be obtained—but
of one thing he was sure.  On one
subject all his early environment made
him extremely susceptible, and that was in
the matter of employment.
</p>

<p>
Everyone he had ever known had always
had a haunting fear at the back of his
mind lest he should lose his job.  A job
was a thing to be clung to like life itself,
at least until a chance of a better one
presented itself.  Pethwick as a boy had had
ample opportunity of observing the miseries
of unemployment; Dorothy's mention
of the possibility touched him in a tender
spot.  Perhaps there was no other way at
all in which she could have induced him
to be methodical in his love.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was only natural that after their
lucid interval they should relapse again.
The glowing future of fame and comfort
and love which Dorothy painted for them
seemed to be very close at hand, and they
kissed again in rapture, and they swore
eternal faithfulness to each other, as if it
were the first time in the history of the
world that such vows had ever been exchanged.
</p>

<p>
Then in the midst of it all something
happened.  Dorothy went rigid in Pethwick's
arms, and tore herself free of him.
Somebody was opening the street door
with a key, and that somebody could only
be Mary Pethwick.  Fortunately she
fumbled for some time before she got the
key in the lock.  When Mary came in,
stumbling a little as usual, Dorothy had
put on her hat again and was sitting
self-consciously in a chair, while Pethwick was
walking aimlessly and equally self-consciously
about the room.  Mary eyed the two
of them with the endless deliberation of
the person who is not quite sober.  Dorothy
took a grip of herself; she was not born
for intrigue.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Mrs. Pethwick," she
made herself say, brightly.  "I'm so glad
you've come back in time for me to see
you.  I was just saying to your husband
that I didn't think I should be able to
stop very much longer."
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," said Mary Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick tried to be bright.
</p>

<p>
"I was just getting tea ready," he said—and
as he said it realization came upon all
three of them.
</p>

<p>
"What a funny smell," said Mary Pethwick,
and Dorothy went tense and a chill
ran down her spine, and Pethwick strode
hastily into the kitchen.  The little place
was full of steam; the gas still burned in
the ring on the top of the oven, and on
the ring lay a few twisted bits and slips
of metal—all that remained of the kettle
which Pethwick had set on the gas half
an hour before.  He tried vainly to conceal
the spectacle from his wife as she came
lurching after him.  Dorothy knew his
endeavour would be unsuccessful.  Still
keeping herself in hand she forced herself to
enter the kitchen as well, and to be
material about it.
</p>

<p>
"There!" she said, "We've forgotten all
about the kettle!  I'm afraid that's my
fault, Mrs. Pethwick.  The Doctor wanted
to get the tea, and I wanted to talk, and
between the two of us we simply forgot
all about it."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy tried to laugh.  She told herself
as she did so that the noise she managed
to produce was more like the rattling
of a skeleton's bones.
</p>

<p>
Mary rolled a wide and stupid eye upon
her.  She said nothing, and hope surged
in Dorothy's breast that perhaps she had
drunk too much to notice anything odd
about the situation.  Pethwick tried his
best to ease the tension.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have the other kettle boiling in a
minute," he said.  "You take Miss Laxton
into the sitting room, Mary.  Tea won't be
long."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy noticed with approval that he
did not sound like a stage conspirator as
he spoke.  He used the same mild tenor in
which he always spoke; it neither trembled
nor went flat.  Dorothy did not really
appreciate this excellence of acting was
due to his natural simplicity.  If he had a
a commonplace thing to say he could not
help but say it in a commonplace manner,
whatever the tension around him.  Dorothy
thought it was an undiscovered talent for
diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
The approval she felt did nothing,
however, to sustain her during that grim
interval in the sitting-room before the
reappearance of Pethwick.  The room was
swelteringly hot, and to her it felt hotter
still.  She tried to act as she would have
acted if she had been paying a call and
had not just been kissing Dr. Pethwick—which
meant that she had to talk in a
spritely manner on indifferent subjects.
</p>

<p>
She tried to keep her voice from
trembling and her tone normal.  But Mary
only regarded her with wide expressionless
eyes and replied with monosyllables.  Dorothy
began to feel frightened, until at last
the door opened and Pethwick came
blundering in with the tea-tray.
</p>

<p>
Despite all Dorothy's strong opinions on
the equality of sexes it irked her to see
him doing women's work.  She felt
annoyed that he should have to make tea
and cut bread and butter and put cakes
on a plate while this horrible woman sat
and did nothing.  But the feeling of
annoyance was all the same overlaid by the
intense embarrassment of the situation,
No one ate very much, Mary because she
habitually ate very little, and Dorothy and
Pethwick because they had no appetite.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy crumbled a piece of bread and
butter; she drank half a cup of tea (in
which Mary had put sugar although
Dorothy disliked it) and then stood up and
said she must go.  Mary, still impassive and
expressionless, bade her goodbye without
attempting to retain her.  Pethwick saw
her to the door.  She felt awkward as she
said goodbye to him; she could not meet
his eyes.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
There is a certain diabolical cunning
which is the gift of drunkenness.
Despite her mazed and muzzy state when she
came in Mary had been able to draw the
obvious conclusion from the data
presented to her—from that melted kettle,
and from Dorothy's embarrassed manner,
and from Pethwick's unconcern.  Such
was her cunning that she knew on the
instant that she could not trust herself to
act effectively on the spot; she would
need time to make a plan and carry it
through, and until that time came she had
best act stupidly.
</p>

<p>
A woman of Mary's type does not face
the possible loss of her husband with
equanimity.  Mary would fight tooth and
nail to keep Pethwick—there is no need
to debate the question as to whether or
not she loved him; the factor of decisive
importance was that she wanted him and
was determined to keep him.  Even if no
other feeling entered into the matter, it
was to Pethwick that she owed a social
eminence among her friends which she
valued, and the moderate amount of
money she needed, and the prestige of
being a married women.  She was not
going to risk the loss of these, to face the
gratified pity of her friends, without a
struggle.
</p>

<p>
For thirty-six hours she brooded over the
business, solitarily.  Then, when self-pity
overcame her, she plunged into one day's
drunkenness.  During that day she seemed
less than human.  It appeared impossible
that any train of thought could survive
in that drink-sodden brain.  But when the
two bottles of whisky were finished (Mary
had never acquired any degree of immunity
to alcohol) she emerged from the
debauch with trembling hands, sick and
shaken, and yet with a plan matured and
ready for use.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to say how much of it was
conscious thought and how much of it
blind instinct.  Mary had never admitted
to herself that she ever drank at all, and
yet she deliberately forced herself into
complete sobriety, denying herself the
soothing little sips for which her jangled
nerves shrieked incessantly.  She knew that
to carry the plan through she must be
rigidly sober—it was bad for her temper,
but she held to it with the obstinacy of
a mad woman.  After two days of complete
abstinence she sallied forth to return
her call upon Miss Laxton.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's heart sank when the parlour-maid
announced "Mrs. Pethwick."  The
visit had taken her quite by surprise.
There was no time to do anything.  She
was "at home" that afternoon, Mrs. Pethwick
was already entering the room, and
it was only ten minutes past three—it
might be as much as an hour before
anyone else came in.  She put down her book
and rose to meet whatever was to come.
But here, in her own house, nearly a week
after she had last been kissed by Dr. Pethwick,
she felt equal to anything.  If
Mrs. Pethwick had come to make a scene, or
if she had come to be more subtly rude,
or if she had merely come calling, she
would stand her ground and give as good
as she got.
</p>

<p>
"What a pleasure to see you!" she said,
crossing the room to meet her.  "You don't
come nearly often enough.  Bring the tea
in, please, Beatrice.  Where will you sit,
Mrs. Pethwick?"
</p>

<p>
They sat down, and they tried to talk
politely while Beatrice jingled in with the
tea-tray and while Dorothy poured out
tea.  Then, when the door was shut again,
and they were settled down, there was a
curious little pause, as if she were waiting
for the other to speak.  Just for a moment
there fluttered through Dorothy's mind a
memory of what she had read about
Fontenoy—of the French officers who
called out, "<i>Messieurs les Anglais, tirez les
premiers!</i>" as the lines closed.  But the
impression of hostility vanished at once.
Mrs. Pethwick was obviously in a good
temper, and obviously quite sober.
Dorothy, with only a hearsay knowledge of the
effects of drink, decided that Mrs. Pethwick
must have no recollection at all of
their two previous encounters—of the
incidents of the black eye and the melted
kettle.
</p>

<p>
"Have another piece of bread and butter?"
said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Mrs. Pethwick.  "I don't
mind if I do."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause while she munched.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Mrs. Pethwick, putting
the bitten slice carefully on her plate,
"you see, I've got to start feeding myself
up now."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy moved uneasily in her chair.
She had a horrid doubt—a horrid certainty
of what Mrs. Pethwick was going to
say next.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of good nourishing food," said
Mrs. Pethwick, complacently.  Dorothy's
movement had not escaped her.  "Of
course, it's early days yet for me to be
quite sure—not even a month—but I don't
think there's any mistake this time.  My
Ed's awfully pleased.";
</p>

<p>
"W-what?" said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"It's about time, isn't it?  We've been
married ten years."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Dorothy, wildly, "I think so."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pethwick laughed with admirable
self-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy could not bring herself to say
anything even idiotic now.  Every single
word of Mrs. Pethwick's seemed to go
clean through her skin and then stick
there, barbed and rankling.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd better tell you early,"
said Mrs. Pethwick.  "You see, Ed being a
schoolmaster—it's not like any other job.
I'll have to keep myself to myself quite
soon."
</p>

<p>
"Don't—oh, <i>don't</i>," gasped Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"You take my tip," said Mrs. Pethwick,
apparently not hearing what Dorothy said.
"When you're married, you 'ave one or
two kids—don't you listen to them that
say they wouldn't for worlds.  It makes a
wonderful difference to a man.  My Ed's
been so attentive this last week or two
you'd hardly know him."
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute," said Dorothy—or she
tried to say it, or something similar;
whatever it was, it unintelligible.  She hurried
out of the room and ran upstairs.  She
could not bear it any longer.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Mrs. Pethwick sat and preened herself
in her armchair.  Her ingenuity
had been successful.  The same diabolical
malice which enabled her to think of
those things to say to her husband which
hurt most had served its purpose to
perfection here.  Naturally she had not been
as clever as she thought she was; it had
had not been nearly as ingenious an
invention as she believed it to be.  It was not
hard to guess that her husband let his
new love know somehow or other that he
did not love his wife and if he had told
her, the most convenient way of hurting
her would be to tell her the opposite,
convincingly.  Mrs. Pethwick, smoothing down
her frock over her swollen thighs, knew
that it had been convincing enough.
</p>

<p>
There have been tortures and torments
recounted in all the literature of the
world, but perhaps there has never been
anything as bad as the torment Dorothy
suffered that afternoon.  The doorbell rang
as she paced the floor of her room.  She
heard Beatrice bring in another caller.
She had to go downstairs again.  She had
to greet her visitors, and pour out tea, and
talk lightly, despite the pain that tore her
heart-strings.
</p>

<p>
The other guests were mildly surprised
and a little contemptuous at finding
Mrs. Pethwick there, but she did not try to
enter into their conversation.  While they
talked and gossiped gaily to each other,
and to Dorothy, Mrs. Pethwick sat in her
corner and smoothed down her frock.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton came in towards the end
and talked with the usual boisterous good
humour which constituted his social
manner towards his inferiors.  It was only
Dorothy, distractedly pouring out tea, who
felt the oppression of the presence of the
woman in the corner who said nothing.
</p>

<p>
And when the last of them had gone,
Dorothy was able to tear herself free from
her father on the plea of a headache—she
who had never made that Victorian
excuse before in her life!  Up in the
sanctuary of her bedroom she could not
lie down, nor sit down.  She could only
walk up and down, up and down, in the
alley-way between the bed and the
wardrobe.  The pain of it all was unbearable.
</p>

<p>
Even if he had not lied about it, even if
he really loved her, Mrs. Pethwick's
condition left Dorothy's hands tied.  The
dreams of a golden future in which she
had been indulging would never come to
fruition.  She could hot take away the
husband of a woman who had a little tiny
baby.  (And expressing it in those words
made the pain worse than ever.)  A man
had to stand by his wife in those
circumstances, come what might.  And Pethwick's
child (the pain became worse still),
Pethwick's child must not be abandoned to the
sole guardianship of Mrs. Pethwick.  No
one could be so heartless.  Pethwick would
make a good father.
</p>

<p>
Then she remembered anew that she
hated him.  She remembered the smell of
stale drink and stale sweat which had
reached her nostrils when she had put
Mrs. Pethwick to bed.  How could Pethwick
bear to embrace that woman?  Or kiss her?
Or after kissing that woman, how could
he come straight from her arms to Dorothy's
kisses?  Dorothy's feeling of nausea
nearly overcame her at the thought of it.
As the paroxysm passed she found herself
trying to reason again, telling herself that
he was a married man, and that men are
insensitive about such things—and with
that her thoughts proceeded to describe
once more the full circle they had already
followed.
</p>

<p>
Somebody banged on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Dinner's ready," said the voice of Henry
Laxton, junior.
</p>

<p>
"Go to Hell," said Dorothy.  She heard
a surprised Henry go clumping down the
stairs again, and her thoughts raced off
once more along the path of pain.
</p>

<p>
Then came another knock.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy, Father says—"
</p>

<p>
"Tell Father to go to Hell too."
</p>

<p>
They left her in peace after that—or
that is how the male Laxtons would have
described it, not knowing what was going
on in that bedroom.
</p>

<p>
It was not until very much later, not
until hours of dry-eyed agony had elapsed,
that tears came to the rescue and provided
a safety valve.  Dorothy had not wept for
years; she had long ago decided that the
prevailing belief that women weep more
readily than men was a myth of the same
class as the belief that women are bigger
talkers or worse motor-drivers or less
original thinkers than men.  Be that as it
might, Dorothy wept bitterly; which
implied that soon she was weeping from
wounded pride and because of her feeling
of humiliation just as much as from her
sorrow.  In the end Dorothy did something
which she had not believed, since she left
off reading schoolgirl literature, to be
possible.  She cried herself to sleep.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
In the morning her pride was reestablished.
It had been wounded by the
thought that she had shared a man's
kisses with a woman who did not clean
her teeth; it had been wounded by her
discovery that the veneer of easy going
tolerance about men and women which she had
acquired at Oxford was only a veneer; it
had been wounded by her discovery that
she could feel so deeply about a man who
was obviously worthless.  But on account,
presumably, of these woundings, her pride
was up in arms, more evident even than
usual.
</p>

<p>
The pain was gone; all that remained
was a slight dull ache, as though a tooth
which had been causing agonizing pain
had been drawn and the jaw had not yet
quite healed—an analogy which was
completed by the sensation of something
missing which she experienced every few
seconds; something gone from her life.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy had eaten no tea and no dinner
the night before.  She completed a twenty-four
hours' fast by eating no breakfast
and no lunch before she set out, after,
school hours, to pay back some of the
hurts she had received.
</p>

<p>
She walked across the High Street and
slowly down Verulam Road.  At the end
of the Verulam Road she turned and
walked very fast back to the High Street,
and when she reached the High Street she
turned again and walked very slowly back
down the Verulam Road.  It was not the
first time she had done this.  She had done
the same for interviews 5 and 6, because
Dr. Pethwick on his way home from the
Liverpool School walked down Verulam
Road from the High Street, and by adjusting
matters carefully Dorothy could contrive
that he overtook her and that their
meeting might appear accidental.
</p>

<p>
Today when she reached the High Street
corner for the third time she saw him
picking his way in his usual sleepy manner
through the traffic, and she had only
walked twenty yards back along Verulam
Road when she heard his step close behind
her.
</p>

<p>
"I was wondering if I should see you,"
said Dr. Pethwick, altering his shambling
step to suit her.
</p>

<p>
His mild grey eyes were bright with
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Dorothy, and several seconds
elapsed before she continued, "I didn't
want to see you.  I was hoping I would not."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick could not, later, have said
what actual words Dorothy had spoken.
The tone she used sufficed to serve the
purpose.  He knew that fate had come
upon him.
</p>

<p>
"But perhaps it is as well," said Dorothy,
"that I have seen you.  Because now I can
tell you that I never want to see you again."
</p>

<p>
A suburban street is emphatically not
the place for a lovers' quarrel.  When
walking side by side it is hard for one to see
the expression on the other's face.  There
is too much limitation upon words and
gestures.  Misunderstandings are easy and
explanations are difficult.  But more than
that, there is a drabness about the
atmosphere, a monotony about the surroundings,
which accentuate the misery of the
quarrel.
</p>

<p>
The grievances of the aggrieved party
seem somehow deeper, and the dreary
pavements and dull horses rob the other
party of his good spirits and optimism so
that he can do little to heal the breach.
The surroundings certainly played their
part in Dorothy's mental attitude.  They
brought home to her what she had been
doing.  She had been indulging in a vulgar
intrigue with a secondary schoolmaster,
kissing him in a shabby little two-bedroom
house with plush furniture.  She wondered
how she could have fallen so low after
she had had four years in Oxford, when
the beauties of the Dolomites and of
Amalfi were familiar to her, and when her
mind was filled with beautiful ideas.
</p>

<p>
She was disgusted with herself, and she
told herself that her two years of
housekeeping in this suburb must have
mildewed her.  She had forgotten all the
glorious pity that once moved her, and
certainly she had forgotten the fact that
she had once even admired the man at her
side.  She was merciless now.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem very surprised at what
I am saying," she said.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
He was not.  It did not surprise him that
a Lordly One should dismiss him from her
presence.  The only wonder was that she
had borne with him so long.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what did you <i>do</i> it for?" asked
Dorothy with exasperation.  "You knew all
the time it couldn't last."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it couldn't," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
At this point Dorothy was brought up
against the realization that if she blamed
it all on Pethwick, which was the point to
which the conversation was tending, she
left herself the appearance of the
weak-willed and gullible person she was
determined not to be.  She was determined to
hurt.
</p>

<p>
"You're a liar and a coward," she said,
viciously.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick winced at that.  He could accept
dismissal as something inevitable, like
falling down when learning to skate, but
even a low-spirited professor of
mathematics can feel hurt when he is called a
liar and a coward.  Pethwick was hurt far
too deeply to make any reply.  He could
only open and shut his mouth.  Dorothy
went on to pour venom, into the wounds
she had laid open.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't have hated you for being a
coward," she said.  "I thought all along
that's what you were.  But that you should
lie to me.  Me!  You cur!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy had never uttered the word
"cur" before in her life, although she had
read it in books.  But such was the
intensity of her feelings that the word came
out perfectly naturally—as naturally as
the heroine of a melodrama would say it.
Dorothy was not feeing melodramatic.  She
was being it, instead.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick was out of his depth by this
time.  He did not know and could not
imagine what it was that he was being
accused of.  If he had said so; if Dorothy's
vicious attack had only made him lose his
temper, there was still a chance for them
both.  But he was hampered by his feeling
of respect; he could not bring himself to
combat Dorothy's decision.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't made a fool of me, the way
you thought you would," said Dorothy.
"And I could make you sorry, too, but I
won't.  I'm not going to that much trouble,
you poor fool, you.  I shan't ever see you
again.  I'm going to Norway with Father
this holiday."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
By now they had reached the corner
of Launceton Avenue, and Pethwick
stopped automatically.  He had said
good-bye to Dorothy at this corner five times.
He stood looking down at her, his features
twitching with the pain she had caused
him.  Dorothy met his eyes once, and then
looked away again.  Her latent sense of
justice prompted her to say all she could
for him.
</p>

<p>
"I thought better of you once," she said,
and with that she left him, standing there
with his papers under his arm, and his
shoulders bowed, while she hurried away,
never once looking back.  It was not until
two or three minutes had elapsed that he
turned towards his house, dragging his
feet along the pavement like an old, old
man.
</p>

<p>
If he had thought about it, he would
have prayed that Mary was not going to
be "difficult" on this evening of all
evening.  But it was only when he was inside
the door that he remembered Mary's
existence, and Mary was not "difficult".
Mary knew, with that diabolical intuition
of hers, that her schemes had borne good
fruit even as he crossed the threshold.
She was sweetness itself at once, a better
wife to him than she had been for years.
Partly it was because she was pleased at
her success, but partly it was with some
obscure and indefinite motive impelling
her to show him that she was worth more
than all the Dorothys on earth.  Or it may
have been some lurking sense of good
behaviour.  She took his parcel from him and
put it on the table, and stood by him
while he dropped into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Tired?" she asked gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick, under his breath.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bring your tea in for you here,"
said Mary, just as though it were her usual
habit to make his tea for him.
</p>

<p>
She brought in the tray, and rested it on
the piano-stool which she brought up
conveniently close to his elbow.  It was a
tempting-looking tray, as tempting as her
dulled mind could devise.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything else you'd like?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick roused himself to look at the tray.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you, dear," he said, automatically.
</p>

<p>
"I'll pour you out a cup," said Mary and
did so.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick still sat vacantly in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Be sure you drink it while it's hot,"
said Mary lightly.  Then she went out on
tiptoe.
</p>

<p>
In the end Pethwick drank it, not while
it was hot, but before it was stone-cold,
and he poured himself out another cup,
feverishly, and drank that, too, and then
a third.  The habit of drinking tea was so
much a part of his nature that even the
present crisis could not quite suppress it.
The tea did much towards quietening the
turmoil of aimless thought in his mind.  He
began to think consecutively again, sitting
there in the chair with the untasted food
beside him.
</p>

<p>
Later, when Mary peeped in through the
door, he was still sitting there, a little
more upright than usual, staring through
the wall at nothing at all.  Mary's intuition
kept her from breaking in upon his
thoughts, and she shut the door again as
gently as she could.
</p>

<p>
It was a full hour, all the same, before
Pethwick was really conscious of more
than the misery within him.  In the
beginning he was merely aware of a sense
of loss, so acute that it is hard to describe.
Just as a person in physical pain turns
this way and that in the hope of relief,
and all unavailingly, so every attitude
his mind adopted was found impossible
by reason of the agony of having lost
Dorothy.  More than that; of late—and
especially during the last three days—his
every thought had been influenced and
coloured by the faint exhilarating
prospect that one day Dorothy might be nearer
to him.  That was impossible now; she was
eternally and immeasurably far away.  He
was brought up against this realization at
every turn, and it added to his pain,
because it was easy at first, in his early
stupidity, to begin lines of thought which
his mind had grown accustomed to—lines
of thought which led towards Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Mercifully, bewilderment came later and
helped to neutralise the pain.  He was able
to bring himself at last to try and
remember the things Dorothy had said to him,
and to try and work out the reason for
his dismissal.  Here he was hampered by
his humility.  He naturally assumed that
Dorothy, by virtue of her status as a Lordly
One, had every right to dismiss him
without explanation—without reason, for that
matter.  She was perfectly entitled, in his
opinion, to hurt him as much as the whim
took her.
</p>

<p>
The assumption, however, was not entirely
satisfying.  The scientific brain
demanded examination of all other hypotheses
before adhering to the most likely—and
the scientific brain was at work, somewhere,
beneath all the agony.  Dorothy had
called him a liar and a coward; Pethwick
forced himself to consider this matter;
in the same way a doctor might force
himself to handle his own broken leg.  If
Dorothy had called him a liar it must be
because he had told her something which
she believed not to be true.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick went back in his mind
examining his memory of what he had told
her.  He was biased.  He could not bring
himself to think that the things he
sincerely believed in, the things he had felt
to be true, or had known to be true, might
be doubted by anybody.  He ruled at once
out of the argument, then, any question
as to whether he loved her, or would
always love her.  The fact that he did not
love his wife was so much of a fact, so
solid and indisputable, that he only gave
it the most fleeting moment's thought.
</p>

<p>
There were other matters on which his
conscience pricked him a little—so little
that until he began this examination he
had been quite unaware of it.  This
disarmament business, for instance.  He had
not been as enthusiastic in the cause of the
reduction of armaments as had Dorothy;
his enthusiasm had been, if not the result
of mere politeness, at least devoid of
Dorothy's pure fanaticism.
</p>

<p>
Many of Dorothy's arguments had appeared
far-fetched to his logical mind; he
told himself guiltily that he would never
have agreed with them so completely if it
had not been Dorothy who had put them
forward.  He had been a liar for agreeing
with her, and a coward for not stating his
objections.
</p>

<p>
This evening Pethwick only worked as
far forward as this point before the
feeling of loss returned again in overwhelming
force.  Dorothy had been eminently
successful in her aim of hurting him as much
as she had been hurt; the weak point was
that if Pethwick had been the kind of liar
she thought he was he would never have
suffered so much.  As it was he suffered
in the way a child suffers; he was plunged
into bottomless misery.  It seemed as if
there were no hope or joy left on earth.
</p>

<p>
In fact, there seemed to be nothing on
earth left to live for.  The discovery of the
Klein-Pethwick Effect was nothing when
weighed in the scales against this present
calamity.  Pethwick would have contemplated
death quite calmly had the idea
presented itself to him.  But he was not
of the impulsive kind which tends toward
suicide.  And by a curious association of
ideas as soon as he realized that he was
both unhappy and tired, he began
automatically to go to bed.  He had gone to
bed unhappy so often before.
</p>

<p>
As ever, the routine of tooth-cleaning
and hand-washing did much to calm his
mind.  He crept into the bedroom as he had
done so often before, and got ready for
bed in the dark room lit only by such light
as crept in through the windows from the
street lamps outside.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
The chaos attendant upon the end
of the scholastic year had descended
upon the Liverpool School.  The Sixth
Formers who had just endured their
Matriculation examination and were going
to leave idled wantonly about the school,
beyond all control.  The middle forms had
recovered from their school examination
and were delighting in the freedom from
supervision which they enjoyed while the
harassed staff were marking papers and
preparing reports.  The junior forms were
wild with excitement at the near approach
of the holidays; they were drunk with
sunshine and restless in confinement.
</p>

<p>
The commonroom was always full of
irritated masters with piles of unfinished
reports before them, trying hard to think
of five-word remarks (about small boys
whom they only knew vaguely) which had
not been used before; would express
politely what they thought and yet not
irritate parents unduly, and which would
impress the headmaster with their keenness
of observation and painstaking understanding.
</p>

<p>
The headmaster himself was harassed
with the suspense of awaiting the report
of the Board of Education, and the results
of the public examinations; he had to find
jobs for half the boys who were leaving;
he had to fill up vacancies on the staff,
he had to keep his eye on the financial
situation as presented to him by the
School Secretary, and he had to face a
drop in numbers due to the new entries
being fewer than the departures.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick moved through all this
turmoil like a being in another world.  He
had quite forgotten to worry about whether
the Matriculation results would justify the
Governors in continuing to pay him the
large salary which he drew.  He blandly
ignored the riotous high spirits of the
forms he had to teach.  The most ingenious
tricks played by Horne and Hawkins and
their imitators failed to penetrate through
the indifference with which he regarded
them.
</p>

<p>
He went through the report-writing
business completely unmoved.  Having made
up, or remembered from last year, thirty
remarks which could be used on reports,
he used these thirty for every form on
which he had to report, in the arbitrary
order in which he first thought of them,
so that many boys that year had remarks
made upon their progress in mathematics
or physics which depended solely upon
their alphabetical order.  It was as good
a way as most others, and the mechanical
writing down helped to keep his nervous
condition nearer normal.
</p>

<p>
Unlike any of the other staff, he
contrived to have time for thinking.  The
forms he was supposed to be controlling
did exactly what they liked—and what
that was would take too long to tell—while
he brooded over his trouble.  He did not
even notice the nagging of his wife, which
had started again coincident with her
beginning to drink once more.  He was
developing a fixed idea.  The muddle of
thought in his mind was beginning to
straighten itself out, with pathetic
inaccuracy of direction.
</p>

<p>
The basic necessity under which he
believed himself to labour was to prove to
Dorothy Laxton that he was not a coward
and that he was an ardent advocate of
the reduction of armaments.  At least, he
believed himself to be a coward, but
wanted to prove to Dorothy that he was
willing to dare all that a brave man might
dare.  And if, even now, he felt he was not
quite such a pure fanatic on the subject of
disarmament as was Dorothy, he was set
upon wringing disarmament from a reluctant
world and then bearing it to her as a
trophy.
</p>

<p>
Such was his urgent, terrible determination
to bring this about that he was
soon distinguishable from the ordinary
fanatic only by taking account of the steps
in which he had arrived at that state of
mind.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that if it had not been for
the nearly simultaneous discovery of the
Klein-Pethwick Effect his fanaticism
might have found expression in the more
usual channels.  It is possible—inconceivable
though it appears—that Pethwick
might have become one more of the
pathetic folk who try to further various
causes by walking through the streets
bearing posters with printed messages, or
who speak from soap boxes at street
corners, and who run the gauntlet of hecklers
in Hyde Park on Sunday afternoons.
</p>

<p>
It is possible, though hardly probable.
Pethwick was not a man of words, and,
self-contradictory as it appears, a scientist
is essentially a man of action.  The problems
presented to him are of necessity
problems which can only be solved by
action rather than by debate.  The first
impulse of the scientist with something
to be done is to do something, whether it
be expansion of a mathematical formula,
or testing a hypothesis at the experimental
bench.  There is never any doubt in his
mind whether he should break into action;
the occasional difficulty only is how he
should.
</p>

<p>
The spectacled absentminded professor
beloved of the comic journals, who boils
his watch and times it with an egg in his
hand, may even in actuality do that sort
of thing in his private life.  But in his
laboratory or at his desk he may be as
brimful of action and daring and vigor as
ever was Nelson at the Nile or a financier
in the City.
</p>

<p>
So that Pethwick, now that his attention
was diverted from a scientific problem to a
social one, sought for a way in which to
get into action, and in the Klein-Pethwick
Effect he found the means ready to his
hand.  He was extraordinarily glad that
he had not yet published his results.  He
was aware of his own deficiencies; he
knew that his ignorance of a good many of
the practical details of ordinary affairs
was a serious matter, but that did not
deter him.  He looked upon himself in this
matter as a piece of apparatus which he
had to employ for lack of anything better.
Any scientist worth his salt will struggle
through with makeshift apparatus whose
very weaknesses can be forced to serve the
end in view, as Faraday and Darwin demonstrated.
</p>

<p>
On the last day of term, when school
was over, a taxicab was being loaded up
outside the Headmaster's house, beside
the Liverpool School.  There were trunks
and suitcases, and fishing-rods and guns
and cameras, all the impedimenta of a
holiday party in Norway.  Then came Miss
Dorothy Laxton; and seated herself in the
cab.  She was the advanced guard of the
expedition.  Her duty was to convey
herself and the baggage to Norway by the
ordinary steamer route—her father was
proud of the fact that she could be relied
upon to do so efficiently.  He was to
follow later, after the final meeting of the
Governors; travelling by air via Oslo he
would reach the rendezvous almost as soon
as she did.  Henry Laxton junior would
follow later still, when the Officers'
Training Corps camp was over.
</p>

<p>
As Dorothy got into the cab, a tall bowed
figure came walking past the house on the
opposite side of the road.  This was
Dr. Pethwick.  He carried a heavy suitcase
which he set down on the ground at sight
of Dorothy.  Dorothy caught sight of him
standing there staring across at her, and
she started guiltily.  For a moment a wild
thought came into her head of running
across to him, of saying something to
him, no matter what, which might make
amends for her cruelty of a week before.
But she put the idea aside.  Really sufficient
time had not elapsed for repentance, and
her father and Henry were at the door of
the cab, and the driver had just started
the engine running.
</p>

<p>
"King's Cross, sir?  Right, sir," said the
driver, and let in his clutch.
</p>

<p>
The taxicab moved off and round the
corner, just as Pethwick remembered to
pull off his hat.  Dorothy had one last
glimpse of him standing there with his
suitcase at his feet.  Mr. Laxton, nodding
to him across the road, wondered vaguely
for a moment what old Pethwick was
taking away with him from school in that
battered old suitcase, but he did not think
about it for long.  Old Pethwick was
harmless enough.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
On his arrival at 41, Launceton Avenue,
Dr. Pethwick carried the suitcase up
to the spare bedroom.  His wife was out at
her mother's as usual, and he worked
without interruption for a short while.  The
little bedroom contained an iron truckle
bed without coverings, a deal chair and
dressing-table, and a deal table—all that
Mary, when they had furnished the house
ten years ago, had deemed necessary to
supply for the use of the possible guest
who so far had never come.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick drew the table over to the
window and laid out on it the various pieces
of apparatus which he had brought from
the school.  They were not very complex
nor excessively heavy.  Two of the items
were without the stamp of shop-made
finish—they had been put together by
Pethwick himself, and displayed all the
clumsy efficiency of scientific experimental
apparatus.  Over these two instruments
Pethwick bent with some little anxiety
which was immediately relieved.  The
brittle gauge strips were unbroken; no
damage had been done by their transport.
</p>

<p>
With his long careful fingers Pethwick
began to set the apparatus together.  He
fished a few lengths of wire out of the
suitcase to make his connections, and he
took the electric lamp out of its socket and
replaced it with a double plug from which
two strands of flex could convey power.
One he connected to his main circuit.  The
other he took over to the dressing-table
across the room, on which he mounted the
bit of apparatus which he had devised as
a means to demonstrate in a lecture-room—if
he ever were to do so—the Klein-Pethwick
Effect.  This was a simple little
electro-magnet on a stand, a plain horseshoe
of iron with a few turns of wire round
it; under the poles, which pointed
downward, was a little brass tray, and on the
tray was a bit of iron.  When Pethwick
closed the switch the bit of iron instantly
leaped up to the poles of the magnet and
was held there.
</p>

<p>
Next Pethwick applied himself to the
apparatus on the table.  He made his final
adjustments, stooping to read the Vernier
gauge with care, and then he switched on
the power.  The make-and-break started
its cheerful buzz, and instantly the bit of
iron across the room fell from the magnet
with a little clatter into the brass tray.
Pethwick broke and renewed the circuit;
the iron fell and rose, as often as he did
so—a neat and obvious demonstration of
how the magnetism of the magnet waxed
and waned at his will, four yards away.
Pethwick's apparatus had not suffered in
transport.
</p>

<p>
Yet hardly was he assured of this when
he heard a heavy step on the stair
outside.  Even if he had been given no other
data, Pethwick could have told who it was
by the manner in which the door was flung
open.  Mary made her entrance a full
second, as her custom was, after the door
had crashed against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>thought</i> you were doing something,"
said Mary, standing balancing on the
threshold, her eyes traveling round the room.
</p>

<p>
"I heard you when I came in," went on
Mary.  "What's this you're doing?"
</p>

<p>
"An experiment," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"We don't want experiments in this
house," said Mary.  "A bedroom's not the
place for experiments."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick did what he was about to do
even if Mary had not come back then;
he switched oft his circuits, and began to
dismantle his apparatus.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I should if I were you," said Mary,
when the sound of the make-and-break
ceased and she guessed from his actions
what he was doing.  "You take all that stuff
out of my house.  You'll be blowing us all
up or something."
</p>

<p>
To Mary, although she had been married
for ten years to a doctor of science, the
word "experiment" still connoted explosions
and stenches; her standard of education
was that of the comic strips.  And
the sight of her husband at work on
something she could not understand outraged
her possessive instinct and roused all her
jealousy.
</p>

<p>
"I won't have that going on in my house,"
Mary reiterated.  "You've never done it
before."
</p>

<p>
To Mary's mind this last statement of
hers was an argument.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, dear," said Pethwick.  "I'll
take it all away tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going to take it to?"
demanded Mary, instantly.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick, stooping over his apparatus
as he carefully disconnected the wiring,
told his wife the first lie he had ever told
her in his life.
</p>

<p>
"Back to school," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mary was not accustomed to catching
out her husband in a lie.  She noticed
nothing odd about her husband's tone;
anything unusual about it she attributed to
his constrained attitude.
</p>

<p>
She pounced instead on his next misdemeanor.
</p>

<p>
"So <i>that's</i> where that suitcase went to,"
she said—Pethwick was packing the
apparatus away by now.  "You mind you
bring it back again.  It's hot meant for
things like that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear," said Pethwick, as mildly as ever.
</p>

<p>
"Now come and have your tea," said
Mary.  "Keeping everything waiting like
this."
</p>

<p>
Yet despite all these distractions it was
on that evening that Pethwick matured
his plan.  He went over it again in his
mind, considering every niggling detail.
It was a very typical production of an
over-strained mind, devised with the utmost
care and attention; the only argument
against it being that it was fundamentally
unsound, like some marvellous system of
arithmetic based upon the principle that
two and two make five.
</p>

<p>
For all that, Pethwick's wits had been
sharpened in some ways by his troubles.
It is hard otherwise to understand how he
could anticipate and prepare himself to
encounter all the practical difficulties of
his undertaking.  The logical mind which
could foresee those difficulties could not
reasonably be expected otherwise to
display the ingenuity to circumvent them.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Next morning, the first of the summer
vacation, Pethwick set out from his
house with his suitcase.  He walked down
Launceton Avenue to the corner, and from
there to the High Street, but he did not
go to the school, despite what he had said
to Mary.  He left his suitcase at the station
cloakroom, and from there he went to the
bank.  At first sight this was a legitimate
action enough, for he had his salary check
to pay in—a month's salary in arrears and
one in advance, sixty-five pounds in all.
But when he handed over slip and check
to the cashier he still lingered.
</p>

<p>
"What's my balance now?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Two minutes later the cashier pushed a
slip of paper across the counter to him.
</p>

<p>
"That's without including what you've
just paid in, Dr. Pethwick," he said.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick unfolded the paper, and written
on it were the figures "171 14 9."  That was
the only way Mary was reasonable—she
did not insist on living up to their income,
and did not trouble Pethwick about money
as long as her very modest wants were
satisfied and she was not bothered further.
With the utmost deliberation Pethwick
wrote a cheque and pushed it across.
</p>

<p>
"How will you have this?" asked the
cashier, startled, when he had glanced at it.
</p>

<p>
"In one-pound notes," said Pethwick,
very calmly.
</p>

<p>
The cashier handed over, almost reluctantly,
a sheaf of fifty one-pound notes.
He regarded Pethwick anxiously as he did
so.  Doctor Pethwick appeared by no means
the most suitable person in the world to
entrust with so much readily-disposable cash.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful with it," he said.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick nodded with a fine assumption
of carelessness, and crammed the money
into his breast-pocket.  It was more than
he had ever had on his person at one time
before.
</p>

<p>
Outside the bank he boarded a bus which
took him to the West End, and there he
entered a men's outfitting store—the one
whose advertisements even Doctor Pethwick
had not been able to miss.  For a moment
he stood bewildered in the bustle of
the entrance-hall; until now he had done
all his shopping in small suburban shops
and he was unprepared for this frightening
reception.  He stood just inside the
revolving doors, tall and thin and shabby
and drooping—save for his lack of spectacles
a living example of the conventional
idea of a scientific professor.  He managed
to find his way to the ready-made clothing
department, and there a bright young man
laid hold of him.
</p>

<p>
"Can I be any help, sir?" was what the
young man said, as he had been trained to
do.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Dr. Pethwick.  "I want a suit."
</p>

<p>
The young man inclined eagerly towards
him, and looked his expectancy of further
details.
</p>

<p>
"A <i>good</i> suit," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
Then Pethwick realised that the only
obstacle to his saying exactly what he
wanted was his shyness, and he discarded
that as soon as the realisation came to
him because he was working towards an
end which would not admit of shyness.
</p>

<p>
"And it's got to <i>look</i> a good suit," said
Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the young man, meditatively,
running his eye over Dr. Pethwick's
figure.  Then he plunged and went on.  "At
that rate I should have something in grey
flannel, sir.  Something of this sort."
</p>

<p>
He drew Dr. Pethwick over to a corner to
where grey flannel suits in endless variety
hung by hangers from a rail—suits of the
most delicious shades of silver grey, grey
with green chalk-mark squares, grey with
white lines.  It was a God-sent opportunity
for the young man, because people who are
going to buy twelve-guinea flannel suits
do not usually wait until nearly August
before buying; the young man was
determined to clear off stock which was
beginning to hang fire.
</p>

<p>
"Something like this," said the young
man.  "Double-breasted.  With your figure,
I should have white chalk lines.  It'll look
well.  Let me take your measurements, sir,
and we'll try one or two on."
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later Dr. Pethwick
stood in the mirrored dressing-room
trying to recognize himself.  Always before
he had bought suits which were either
navy blue or clerical grey—he had
alternated from one to the other for fifteen
years—because it had never occurred to
him to do otherwise.  He had never
pictured himself in habiliments which he had
mentally considered to be the prerogative
of Lordly Ones.  But now he was wearing
a double-breasted pearl-grey suit which
looked really well—the sort of suit people
like governors wore on Sports Day.
</p>

<p>
The vertical white lines accentuated his
height, the double-breasted coat accentuated
his breadth, so that he looked twice
the man he did in shabby blue serge.
And the shop had substantiated its
advertised boast to fit any figure in ten
minutes.  To Dr. Pethwick's untrained eye
the cut of the suit was as good as anything
Sir Dumbril Haydock or Mr. Laxton ever
wore.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that will do quite well," said
Dr. Pethwick, eyeing himself as steadily as
he could manage.  He looked with a
considering gaze at the cheerful young man
fluttering round him.
</p>

<p>
"Now I want everything to go with it,"
he went on.  "Hat, shoes, shirt, everything."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  I'll come with you, sir; and
see about it."
</p>

<p>
Some of the advertisements had made a
distinct impression on Dr. Pethwick's
mind—advertisements which told stories of
men with unexpected wedding invitations,
or who had met with motor-car accidents
on the way to important interviews; these
men had despairingly called in at the shop
and had been instantly outfitted afresh
all ready for whatever it was they were
going to do.  Dr. Pethwick wanted the
same done by him, and, sure enough, it was.
</p>

<p>
The bright young man took him to a
myriad counters, and summoned a myriad
other bright young men to attend to them.
Here they bought a hat, and there they
bought shoes.  The bright young man did
most of the selecting, and if it were the
expensive things which he chose, with an
eye to his commission, he also did his
honest best to outfit Dr. Pethwick like a
gentleman.  A coloured handkerchief for
his breast-pocket, a tie of the right shade,
wash-leather gloves, silver-mounted cane,
a shirt and collar—all these were bought
and sent up to the dressing-room to await
Dr. Pethwick's pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick left it all to him.  He did
not think it worth while to protest when
the young man brought him braces and
underclothes.  No one was going to see his
underclothes, and the solid leather braces
he had had since boyhood were good
enough for him, but he had asked to be
supplied with everything and he was not
going to draw back now.  So, he bought
braces of a magnificence of which he had
never conceived before, and sock suspenders
to match, and silk underclothing, and
gold sleeve-links—severe but magnificent.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Back in the ready-made clothing
department the bright young man made
a hasty abstract of the innumerable bills
which had collected there.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty pounds four and sevenpence,
sir," said the bright young man.
</p>

<p>
Without a tremor Dr. Pethwick produced
his sheaf of notes and counted out thirty-one
of them.
</p>

<p>
"You want to put these clothes on now,
sir, I suppose?" said the bright young man.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir.  I'll call the valet.  And
where am I to send the old ones?"
</p>

<p>
It says much for Dr. Pethwick's determination
that he faced a double crisis like
this without flinching.  He accepted the
fact of the valet unmoved; with regard to
the need for keeping Mary unaware of his
new purchases he said, casually:
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll take them with me.  I suppose I
shall want a suitcase.  Have one sent up
and packed for me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the bright young man;
five seconds later Dr. Pethwick was in
the mirrored dressing-room again and yet
another bright young man, with sleek hair,
all teeth and smiles and hand washing, was
helping him to dress.  He was a model valet;
he took the ragged shirt and the deplorable
woollen undervest as if they were
royal robes, and laid them reverently aside
before proffering to Dr. Pethwick the silk
underclothes.  He knelt to adjust the new
sock suspenders until they were exactly
right.  He saw to it that the marvellous
braces were of the right length to set off
the line of the trousers.  He put the
sleeve-links into the shirt, and he said "Allow me,
sir," and with two dexterous touches he
repaired the hopeless hash Dr. Pethwick
had made of tying the new tie.
</p>

<p>
He whipped a shoehorn out of his
hip-pocket and gently eased Dr. Pethwick's
feet into the new shoes.  He helped
Dr. Pethwick into the double-breasted coat
and walked round and round him, unobtrusively,
twitching it until it sat exactly
right.  When Dr. Pethwick dubiously put
on the new felt hat with the snap brim he
said "Allow me, sir" again, and cocked it
just a shade over Dr. Pethwick's right
eyebrow and snapped the brim down to the
perfect slope.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick, looking in the mirror, saw
himself wearing a hat as he knew it ought
to be worn but in a way he had never
dared—at the angle which indicated
independence of mind without rakishness,
gentlemanliness without formality.  He had
never had any idea that he could look so
well.  He fumbled with the yellow gloves,
and, on the valet's suggestion, decided to
carry them.  Hat on head, gloves and cane
in hand, he was ready for the street.  He
paid yet one more bill—for his new
suitcase—and took a last glance at himself
in the mirror.
</p>

<p>
The valet picked up the suitcase and
fixed him with a glittering eye.  He must
have been skilled in thought transference,
for Pethwick understood him instantly,
and handed over a half-crown tip.  Then
they went down together in the lift and
out to the front door.
</p>

<p>
"Taxi, sir?" said the valet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick.  He had never
been in a taxi in his life before, poor man,
but time was passing rather fast and he
still had much to do.  A taxicab came up
at the valet's summons.
</p>

<p>
"Where to, sir?" asked the valet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tell him—just tell him to drive
towards the City."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the taxicab whirled
round the merry riot of Piccadilly Circus
en route for Leicester Square, the Strand,
Fleet.  Street, and the City.
</p>

<p>
At the Bank of England the taxicab drew up.
</p>

<p>
"This is the 'eart and centre of the
City," said the driver.  "Where do you
want to go now?"
</p>

<p>
"This will do," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
He paid the driver, guessing wildly at
what sort of tip was expected of him.  By
a stroke of genius he remembered that by
leaving the suitcase in the cloakroom of
the Bank Underground station he could
avoid having to carry it around with him,
and, that done, he set out to look for a
City office for himself.
</p>

<p>
Among the black coats and quiet grey
suits of the hurrying herds on the
pavement the beautiful pearl-grey suit stood
out in astonishing contrast.  Pethwick himself,
conscious for the first time in his life
of being irreproachably dressed, walked
slowly along Threadneedle Street.  He held
his head high; he walked with dignity, the
silver-mounted cane tapping the pavement.
Save for a certain intellectual quality
about his face and the abstraction of
his expression, he would have passed
anywhere as a young man about town.  Yet
this consciousness of well-being, this new
certainty of himself, did not alleviate his
sorrow after his lost Dorothy, nor did it
blunt the singleness of purpose which now
consumed him.  If anything, it only
intensified them.
</p>

<p>
His steps took him into the backwaters
and alley-ways off the main City streets.
It would be there, if anywhere, that he
would find what he sought.  Sure enough,
he found it.  In Hammer Court there was
a board displayed: "Light offices to let.
Rents from 50.  Apply caretaker."  Pethwick
regarded the building with a thoughtful eye.
He walked out to the entrance of
the court, and took special note of the
volume of traffic in the streets outside.
He gauged the distance from the
intersection of roads to the court.  Then,
crossing his Rubicon, he turned and plunged
into the block of offices.
</p>

<p>
It took a moment or two for his eyes to
grow accustomed to the gloom after the
blinding sunlight outside, but at last he
was able to read on the half-empty
address-board in the hall that the caretaker
lived on the lower ground floor.  He went
down the stairs and rang the bell.  The
door was opened by a decayed woman in
black, who eyed the radiant vision in
silver-grey with dumb amazement.
</p>

<p>
"I am looking for an office," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"'Oos office?" asked the caretaker.
</p>

<p>
"I am looking for an office for myself.  I
want to rent one," explained Dr. Pethwick,
patiently.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the caretaker.  It became
apparent that she held in her hand some
dubious sort of cloth—dishcloth or
floorcloth.  She dropped this behind the door,
and reached down a bunch of keys from a
hook beside her.
</p>

<p>
"'Ow big?" said the caretaker, shutting
the door behind her and setting herself
to plod up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"There's one on the ground floor.  Suite
of five rooms.  Six 'undred pounds a year.
One on the first, four 'undred.  Two small
ones on the second, two 'undred."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't want anything like that,"
said Dr. Pethwick, alarmed.  "Your board
outside said fifty pounds a year.  I only
want a little office.  Just a room."
</p>

<p>
"Ho," said the caretaker, stopping
abruptly in her upward course.  "There's
only one like that, and that's downstairs
along o' me.  D'you want to see it?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
The caretaker came flat-footed down the
stairs again, Pethwick behind her.  She
unlocked a door and threw it open.
</p>

<p>
"There you are," she said.  "Fifty pounds
a year.  Yearly agreement.  Wired for
telephone.  Electric light.  No central
'eating—it doesn't get down as far as here."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick entered the room, and
looked round it.  It was as dark as a
cellar—which is really what it was—and
was some ten feet square.  Two windows
admitted practically no light and made no
promise of air.  The caretaker switched on
the light, revealing the bare cement walls
and floor.  But the room was all that
Pethwick desired.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take it," he said.
</p>

<p>
He sought for his pocket-book, but his
hope that the transaction might be
completed then and there was dashed to the
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Agents are Truman and Todd in Fetter
Lane," said the caretaker woodenly.  "You'll
'ave to settle it with them."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Pethwick.  After all,
it was for the purpose of being able to
encounter agents that he had gone to all
the trouble of buying these fine new
clothes.  "I'll go along there now."
</p>

<p>
He came out of the room.
</p>

<p>
"The W.C.'s over there," said the caretaker,
pointing.  "Tenants are given a key."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
Up in the sunshine again he called a
taxicab.  All this business had taken a little
longer than he had calculated, and he
was only now approaching the crucial
moment of the day.  A pretty girl clerk came
up to him and when he pushed open the
door and entered the office of Messrs. Truman
and Todd.  She smiled charmingly
at him—or at the beautiful grey suit.
</p>

<p>
"I want to rent an office for which I
believe you are the agents," explained
Pethwick.  "In Hammer Court."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said the pretty clerk.  "Step
this, way."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick found himself led into the
presence of Mr. Todd himself.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Todd ran a keenly appraising eye
over Dr. Pethwick as he was ushered in.
Much of the success of an estate agent
depends on his ability to size up a man at
the moment of introduction.  Once more
Dr. Pethwick laboriously stated his business.
</p>

<p>
"Hammer Court," said Mr. Todd, as
though to himself.  "Let me see.  Which
office do you wish to rent?"
</p>

<p>
"The one in the basement," said
Dr. Pethwick.  "The little one."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Todd looked at him more keenly
still; it was not that in referring to the
basement instead of to the "lower ground
floor" Dr. Pethwick was violating estate
agents' good taste, but that Mr. Todd could
not help feeling dubious about people who
could only afford fifty pounds a year office
rent.  There were such people—Mr. Todd
was naturally quite sure of that—but there
was bound to be something doubtful about
them unless the contrary was quite obvious.
</p>

<p>
"What is the business you are proposing
to carry on?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick brought out his pocket-book,
found a visiting card, and handed it
over.  It was one of fifty which he had had
printed when he took his Doctorate, and
he still had forty-five of them.  Mr. Todd
glanced at the card.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Dr. Edward Pethwick, D.S.C.<br>
  <i>University of London</i><br>
</p>

<p>
That was satisfactory, at any rate.  It
made it appear likely that this man could
be identified by the aid of books of reference.
</p>

<p>
"By profession," said Dr. Pethwick, "I am
a schoolmaster.  I am the senior physics
and mathematics master at the Liverpool
School."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Todd nodded.  That also could be
checked up by reference.  But it was a little
odd that a schoolmaster should want a
City office.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it is obvious," went on
Dr. Pethwick, "that I have never been in
business before.  In fact I have only
recently decided on this step.  But I have
recently effected two patents covering
physical processes which may be of some
application in the arts."
</p>

<p>
"And you want to put them on the
market?" said Mr. Todd.
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly right.  Some years ago I
had an unfortunate experience with a
patent agent.  It rendered valueless an
earlier patent of mine, and I promised
myself then that I should never have any
more dealings with agents.  You may have
heard that patent-agents are all thieves."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick smiled.  He told his lies in
his simplest manner.  It did not matter if
Mr. Todd, thought him a fool, as long as
he did not think him a rogue.  And
Mr. Todd did not think him a rogue, nor even
a fool.  He was quite impressed by
Dr. Pethwick's quiet assurance and by his
manner when he repeated that remark
which he had once overheard at a meeting
of the British Association.
</p>

<p>
"I've no hope of making my fortune
from these patents," continued Dr. Pethwick,
modestly, "but it is really very possible
that something quite good may come
of them.  It is becoming necessary that I
should have headquarters somewhere in
the City."
</p>

<p>
"I think we can arrange it," said
Mr. Todd, and Dr. Pethwick saw success in
sight.  Mr. Todd pulled a printed form out
of a drawer.
</p>

<p>
"Here is our usual form of agreement,"
he said.  "I suppose you can give me references?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick took the form and began
to glance through it.  He was deadly calm,
and it was only when he was half-way
through, the reading that he answered
Mr. Todd's question.
</p>

<p>
"I've been puzzling over this reference
business," he said.  "And really, I can't
come to any conclusion.  I've been a master
at the Liverpool School for eleven years.
I don't know anyone whom you could consider
a satisfactory reference.  I'm not sure—it
isn't a matter of great importance,
though—that the School would approve of
my going into business."
</p>

<p>
He smiled again at Mr. Todd, and then
went on:
</p>

<p>
"But I understand that if I make
sufficient payment in advance...?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Todd's expression, which had clouded
over for a moment, cleared at once.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, a year's rent in advance will
be quite satisfactory—Mr. er—Dr. Pethwick."
</p>

<p>
"Then I may as well make out the cheque now?"
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
All the trouble Dr. Pethwick had
taken; his purchase of new clothes,
his careful behaviour towards Mr. Todd
had been solely directed towards the one
end of gaining for himself a foothold free
from observation in the City.  When he
had decided that he wanted one, he had
been brought up short against the need
for references.  The Difficulty was
surmounted now.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick, with the clarity of vision which
had come to him with careful thinking,
had foreseen that no agent would have let
a City office to a shabby man who walked
in without references and without a
convincing story, however much advance rent
he offered.  But Mr. Todd, if he had been
asked, would have said that Dr. Pethwick
was a man of sound ideas who was likely
to get on and who could be thoroughly
relied upon—which was exactly the
impression Dr. Pethwick had set out to convey.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick compelled himself to appear
to read the agreement with care and
attention.  He picked his way through the
crabbed estate agents' English, noting odd
things such as the fact that he promised
not to sleep nor suffer to sleep on the
premises, and the extensive classification
of the businesses he bound himself not to
carry on there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Todd unbent sufficiently to indulge
in a little trivial conversation with
Dr. Pethwick while the final details of the
transaction were worked out.  A touch on
the button of Mr. Todd's buzzer brought
in the pretty girl clerk to witness
Dr. Pethwick's signature; a receipt was made
out and stamped in exchange for the
check for fifty pounds which Dr. Pethwick
made out in favor of Mr. Todd.
</p>

<p>
"I'll send you on a copy of the agreement
signed by our client, Dr. Pethwick,"
said Mr. Todd, in final valediction.  "You
can enter into occupation from that day."
</p>

<p>
And he ushered Dr. Pethwick out again.
The interval of three days, as both
Mr. Todd and Dr. Pethwick knew without
mentioning the subject, would be employed in
waiting to see that Dr. Pethwick's check
was met and in making certain that there
was such a person as Dr. Pethwick holding
a doctor's degree in Science from the
University of London and employed at the
Liverpool School.  Mr. Todd was quite easy
in his mind about it already.  He was sure,
from what he had seen of Dr. Pethwick,
that he would not be likely to make use
of his tenancy of the office in Hammer
Court for any of the lesser or dirtier
criminal offenses, and no one would set out
upon any of the greater swindles with
headquarters in a single basement room.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick emerged into Fetter Lane
a little dazed and fatigued.  Now that the
effort was over he began to feel the strain.
Even the fact that he was wearing
marvellous clothes meant nothing to him now.
</p>

<p>
He still had to make his way to the Tube
station and collect his new suitcase.  Then
he had to engage a dressing-room in the
men's lavatory at London Bridge Station—he
had borne in mind the possibility of
doing this when he made his plans a week
ago—and change out of the fine suit and
the silk underclothes back into the shabby
blue serge and the ragged shirt and vest
in which he had started out.  The good
clothes had to be crushed into the
suitcase—Dr. Pethwick, despite all his abilities,
was deplorably unable to pack—and the
suitcase left at London Bridge Station
cloakroom.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered with a start that
he had to buy yet another suitcase; he
did this before getting into the train for
home.  At the suburban station he took
the first suitcase out of the cloakroom,
and made a discreet retirement in order
to be able to transfer his apparatus to
the new one, which he left deposited at
the station.  Then, with the old one, empty
now, he at last reached 41, Launceton
Avenue, very tired, but very satisfied, save
in one respect.  He had succeeded in
everything; he had remembered
everything—everything except his lunch.  That had
slipped his memory until he realized that
part of his fatigue was due to hunger.
</p>

<p>
It was a pity Mary was at home, because
that precluded him from satisfying his
hunger until tea-time.  Any excursion into
the kitchen and clattering with crockery
would have brought her out to see what
was happening, and the spectacle of her
husband eating at half-past three would
have called not merely for unkind
comments—Pethwick might have borne with
those—but with questions about how he
had spent his time so far that day.
Pethwick had tacitly allowed it to be
understood that he had remained at school
clearing up after the end of the scholastic
year, and he did not feel equal to facing
any acute examination on the point.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
It is easy enough to work out the superficial
reasons why the Pethwicks had not
had a summer holiday away from home for
so many years.  There can be no doubt
whatever that if they had decided upon
such a holiday most of the trouble
involved would have fallen to Mary's lot.
It would have to have been she who
decided where to go, and who booked the
rooms, and who found out about trains,
and who packed, and who saw to it that
the trains were caught, and all that would
have been a great trouble to her.  She
disliked the prospect of so much effort, and
she also disliked the thought of being away
from her favorite public-houses and
cronies.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick, likewise, had equally cogent
reasons for not wanting to go away.  He
shrank from having to face the comparative
publicity of boarding-house life, and
of being thrust into the society of people
he did not know.  He dreaded the fuss and
bother of arrival and departure.  Moreover,
he liked to spend his holidays in
catching up on the serious work of his life.
</p>

<p>
He delighted in spending his holidays in
reading and in calculation; after all, it
was only occasionally that Mary came to
fret about seeing "a man always lounging
about the house," and to chafe at the
need—which she never really fulfilled—of
having to provide a civilized lunch for seven
days a week instead of one.  Moreover,
there were occasional meetings of learned
societies which Pethwick liked to attend,
unobtrusively.  They were rare in August,
but during the rest of Pethwick's holidays
they were frequent enough to supply Mary
both with an excuse not to take a holiday
and with grounds for complaint.
</p>

<p>
So this summer holiday it was not
remarkable that they should have done
nothing about going away.  During the
opening days in July Mary pottered about
the house in a dressing-gown complaining
of the heat until it was time for her to go
and see her mother, while Pethwick sat
and read, or sat and thought, or sat at
the table immersed in calculations.
</p>

<p>
Mary did not notice that on those early
days of the summer holiday Pethwick
spent an unusual proportion of his time in
writing, and she did not notice what he
wrote.  And he was very careful when she
was out of the house to burn all the
discarded drafts—and they were very many
indeed—of what he was writing, and to
keep the latest current draft locked up in
the central drawer of his desk, whose key
was the only one remaining in Pethwick's
possession.  Mary only periodically had
bouts of curiosity, but Pethwick judged it
advisable to keep the document he was
trying to compose safely out of her reach.
</p>

<p>
It took him three days to finish the
thing he was writing—which, after all, was
not too long to spend on a document which
might alter the history of mankind—and
it took him two hours, with Mary safely out
of the way, to make a fair copy of it when
it was completed.  But that length of time
is not a fair measure of the length of the
document, for Pethwick copied it out not
in his own minute legible handwriting, but
in a disguised hand—in other words, he
printed it in Roman capitals, for he had
a vague memory of having read somewhere
that that was the best way of disguising
one's handwriting.  And when it
was finished he sought out a long envelope
and placed the folded foolscap into it with
care.
</p>

<p>
He stuck down the envelope, and began
to address it—"The Editor, <i>The Times</i>."
There he stopped short.  He knew so little
of the world that he had to go and find
that day's issue and hunt through it in
order to discover that <i>The Times</i> office is
in Printing House Square, E.C.  He stamped
the envelope and locked it away again in
his desk.  He stood there thoughtfully,
with the key in his hand, for a second or
two.
</p>

<p>
Only incidentally was he thinking about
the good that letter might do.  More
especially, he was thinking about his lost
Dorothy, four hundred miles away from
him across the sea.  Pethwick surmised
that <i>The Times</i> might penetrate even as
far as the inner recesses of Norway, and
when Dorothy read that letter she would
know that it was he who had written it.
Perhaps she would believe then that he
was not a coward, nor a liar, and that even
if he were not a rabid supporter of
disarmament he was willing at least to
imperil his future to bring it about.
</p>

<p>
Then Pethwick roused himself, and
turned away from his desk to continue his
period of waiting.  When his wife came in
she found him, just as she expected, sitting
in an arm-chair with two books on his
knees and two more on the floor beside
him.  It was as well that she was in an
unwontedly good temper, and so did not
abuse him too violently for making that
shabby room untidy.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick's period of waiting was not
much further prolonged; it was in fact
terminated the very next morning.  He
heard the postman's knock at the front
door soon after he had awakened, with the
morning sunshine in his eyes and his wife
stirring sleepily beside him.  As he had
done on the two previous mornings as well,
he slipped quietly out of bed and padded
downstairs, barefooted and in his pyjamas
to see what the postman had brought.
He opened the long typewritten envelope
expectantly, and the letter inside told him
that he had achieved what he wanted.  It
began—<i>Dear Sir, With regard to your
application for the tenancy of the lower
ground floor office in Tranby House,
Hammer Court, we have now heard from our
client and have much pleasure in</i>—there
followed the information that the office
was now his for a year, that a copy of the
agreement signed by the landlord was
enclosed, and that the caretaker on the
premises had been instructed to hand over
to him the keys of the office.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick hurriedly buried the letter,
agreement, and all, under a mass of odd
papers in his desk, for he did not dare to
go upstairs again for the key to the center
drawer.  It was fortunate that the
postman had brought at the same time some
of those circulars which flood the
letterbox of an assistant schoolmaster who is
also a doctor of science; they made it
possible for Mary to believe that they were all
he had brought.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick could not but help feel a
thrill of excitement at the near
approach of action, but he would not allow
himself to display it at all.  At breakfast
he read <i>The Times</i>, and after breakfast
announced, quite casually, his intention of
visiting the University of London library.
He would not be home to lunch—he would
take that meal at the A.B.C. restaurant at
South Kensington.  The only attention
Mary paid to this announcement was to
feel relieved at having him off her hands
for the day.  She might have been more
interested if she had seen—as Pethwick
took good care she did not—his lightning
spring to his desk when she was out of the
way, and his careful locking away of the
newly-arrived agreement and his careful
placing in his pocket of the stamped
addressed quarto envelope containing the
letter he had finished the day before.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick collected his two suitcases on
his way to the office, and after a momentary
hesitation he hired a dressing-room
in the lavatory at London Bridge Station
and changed into his beautiful new clothes.
That was not really necessary, seeing that
he was now the tenant of the office and
nothing could unmake him.
</p>

<p>
It was a pleasant indication that he
remained human; the most important motive
influencing him was merely the desire to
wear good clothes.  The fine grey flannel
suit had been badly crushed by Pethwick's
packing; the snappy grey hat had lost
some of its shape, and Dr. Pethwick was
not as clever in putting on clothes as the
valet who had previously attended him.
The general effect, taking everything into
consideration, was a caricature of the
well-dressed man who had interviewed
Mr. Todd and the caretaker.  But Dr. Pethwick
did not appreciate this.  He walked
out of the cloakroom with his two suitcases
and hailed a taxicab, feeling quite
pleased with himself, and that at least
was so much gained.  There had been
precious little pleasure so far in Dr. Pethwick's life.
</p>

<p>
The caretaker actually contrived to
raise a smile of welcome for Dr. Pethwick
when he rang her bell on his arrival at
Hammer Court.  Yes, she had heard from
Mr. Todd, and here were the keys.  It
almost seemed, as she walked across the
corridor with Dr. Pethwick to open the
office door for him, as if she had lost the
secret devastating sorrow which had given
her such an air of gloom when Dr. Pethwick
had seen her last.
</p>

<p>
The caretaker threw open the door and
Dr. Pethwick put down his heavy suitcase.
Did Dr. Pethwick need tea in the afternoon?
The caretaker was accustomed to
supplying it to the other offices in the
building.  Messrs. Copley and Henfield, and
the Cottage Supply Association, always
dealt with her.  Sixpence a head a week,
she charged.  Dr. Pethwick shook his head
sadly.  He was afraid he never drank
tea—it was amazing how he had fallen into the
habit of telling the most outrageous lies.
But his secretary?  Secretaries always
wanted tea.  Dr. Pethwick confessed that
he had not yet engaged a secretary.  When
he had found one would be sufficient time
to discuss the question of tea for her—and
with that Dr. Pethwick had to decline,
regretfully, the caretaker's eager offer to
find him one.
</p>

<p>
And what about office furniture?  Pethwick
had difficulty at that moment in
keeping the expression of his face
unchanged.  Until that moment he had
forgotten all about the question of furnishing
the office.  For his own purposes he would
need at least a table and a chair; for the
sake of veri-similitude he would need a
good deal more.  Dr. Pethwick, so the
caretaker said, would find all he wanted at
Mr. George Freeman's round in Morton
Yard.  He dealt in second-hand office
furniture, all good stuff.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick made a mental note of the
name and address, and thanked the caretaker.
This business of making history involved
a tedious amount of detail in its
preliminaries, but at last he was able to
get rid of her, and shut his door, and look
around the dingy room with the eye of a
proprietor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. George Freeman was delighted to
see Dr. Pethwick.  In this time of slump
more people came to him wishing to sell
office furniture than to buy it.  With his
thumb in the arm-hole of his waistcoat he
proceeded to supply Dr. Pethwick with
everything necessary for the efficient
running of an office—desks and tables and
chairs and cupboard, and box-files and
expanding files, and letter trays and
waste-paper-baskets and calendars and ink-stands.
He was a large red-faced man
in a blue serge suit, and he almost carried
Dr. Pethwick away on the current of his
enthusiasm.  But not quite, however.
</p>

<p>
Even Dr. Pethwick jibbed at buying a
typewriter and a copying press.  By some
miracle he thought of an excuse for
postponement; when he had engaged his
secretary and could consult her whims on the
subject would be time enough for buying
typewriters.  But Mr. Freeman sold him
everything else.  Dr. Pethwick wrote out
a large check—he was growing used to
doing this—and Mr. Freeman promised
delivery of the goods that very afternoon.
</p>

<p>
On his way back to the office, to await
their arrival, Dr. Pethwick stopped at a
letter-box.  He brought out the big quarto
envelope from his pocket, and pushed it
into the slot marked "For London and
Places Abroad."  The letter slid irrevocably
down into the slot.  Nothing that Dr. Pethwick
could do could prevent it from being
delivered some time that afternoon to the
Editor of <i>The Times</i>.
</p>

<p>
Then he went back to the office, to pace
up and down the stone floor of the bare
room until the arrival of Mr. Freeman's
van.  It cannot be denied that in the
matter of furnishing his office Dr. Pethwick
did not play his part well.  Mr. Freeman's
henchmen demanded where this should be
put, and that, and the replies they received
were so vague and unconstructive that the
workmen for the most part dumped down
desks and chairs and tables and flies
wherever the whim took them—Dr. Pethwick
had no idea how an office ought to be
furnished and he could not compel himself
to think about it and evolve ideas.  There
was no urgent necessity for him to play a
part before these workmen, and he could
not bring himself to do so.
</p>

<p>
But by the time the workmen had finished
there was a realistic air about that
office, all the same.  Mr. Freeman had sold
him enough office equipment to run a
small government department, and when
it was all in the room was crammed until
there was hardly space to walk.  It
certainly looked as if a colossal amount of
work was intended to be done there.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Next morning at breakfast Dr. Pethwick
opened <i>The Times</i> with his
nerves set and ready to keep his
expression from changing.  He turned over
the pages rapidly, but on none of them was
printed the long letter he had written with
so much trouble to the Editor.  Dr. Pethwick
was by no means surprised.  Somewhere
in his intellectual makeup there still
remained a residuum of cool judgment.  He
had guessed that <i>The Times</i> must receive
every day from cranks and lunatics a
collection of letters every bit as startling as
his; he had fully anticipated that his
letter would be classed with the others, and,
if not put in the-waste-paper-basket, at
least put aside for later consideration.  In
point of fact, Dr. Pethwick had been quite
sure this would happen, and had made all
his arrangements accordingly.  It was only
now that his judgment had been proved
correct that he looked back and thought
he had not been quite sure—but that was
like him.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick was elaborately casual after breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to go to South Kensington
again today," he said.  "Do you mind, Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"Me?" said Mary with elaborate sarcasm.
"Don't ask <i>me</i>.  I don't count.  Go if you
like."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Dr. Pethwick.  "I'll be
back to tea, I expect."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick went up to London in his
shabby everyday clothes, but no sooner
had he slipped into his office and locked
the door behind him than he proceeded
to change into the fine flannel suit, and
the silk underclothes and all, taking them
out with care from the cupboard into
which he had locked them the night
before.  Donning those clothes had become
like a priestly rite to him; he could not
now contemplate action taken without
that suit and those underclothes; they
were like a priest's vestments or a knight's
armor to him now.
</p>

<p>
Properly dressed, and his old clothes
locked away in the cupboard, he proceeded
to take the decisive steps.  He felt no
excitement about it; no additional tension.
Decisive though the moment was, it was
only one stage in the series of actions he
had planned.  Dr. Pethwick had the type of
mind which will not draw back from an
enterprise once begun, nor even contemplate
retirement.  From the moment when
he had entered the Regent Street shop to
buy his fine clothes it was as certain as
anything can be on earth that he would
proceed onwards to this moment and beyond.
</p>

<p>
The preliminaries took very little time.
He unrolled a sheet of drawing-paper and
pinned it on the office table.  With a
compass and a large-scale map of London he
made a few simple measurements which
resulted in the ruling of a line diagonally
across the sheet—very strict accuracy was
not essential, for he had a margin of
possible error of at least ten per cent at his
disposition.  The table stood against the
wall and to the wall Pethwick pinned
another sheet of paper.  He produced a crude
form of sextant—a protractor and a
pendulum made of thread with a weight
attached.  A further brief calculation
resulted in his drawing a sloping line on the
vertical paper.
</p>

<p>
That done, he began to set out on the
table the electro-magnetic apparatus
which he took from the second suitcase in
the cupboard.  With his long steady fingers
he proceeded to make the electrical
connections.  He took the electric lamp out of
its socket, and replaced it with the
two-way plug.  When finally the connections
were complete he began to set the emitter
carefully, first for horizontal direction
along the pencil line on the table, and then
for elevation along the line upon the wall.
He ran his mild grey eyes over the apparatus,
saw that everything was ready, and
then with unhesitating fingers he pressed
the switch.
</p>

<p>
At once the make-and-break began its
cheerful chatter; Pethwick carefully
turned the adjusting screw until the chatter
died away into the merest, tiniest murmur.
</p>

<p>
The thing was done.  The great demonstration
was begun.  All that Pethwick
need do now was to sit down quietly and
let history work itself out.  Indeed, he tried
to do so.  He sat in the swivel chair which
Mr. Freeman had sold him and tried to
compose himself to while away the next
six hours.  But it was more than even
Dr. Pethwick's nerves could stand.  After no
more than five minutes he found himself
getting up from his chair and pacing
about; and two minutes after that he took
the smart grey hat and the snappy yellow
gloves and went out of his office, leaving
his apparatus still at work.  He locked the
door very carefully behind him.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
At the time when Dr. Pethwick was
engaged in putting his apparatus in
running order at the Hammer Court office,
Mr. Prodgers, a lorry driver, was engaged
in driving his lorry containing two tons of
cement in sacks to where the new offices
were being erected in Finsbury Pavement.
The traffic in the City had reached its
morning peak.  Buses, motor-cars, lorries,
were jammed wheel to wheel in the streets.
Progress was slow and difficult, and
Mr. Prodgers, wrestling with his heavy wheel,
had to carry in his mind a very clear
mental picture of the length and width of the
ponderous vehicle behind him as he wound
his way through the press.
</p>

<p>
At one moment, although he found time
to snarl at a driver who was taking a
chance "'Ow long 'ave you 'ad your license,
sonny?  Two days?" he had no leisure to
listen to the reply.  There was a
horse-drawn wagon in front of him, and
Mr. Prodgers was keyed up waiting an
opportunity of overhauling this anachronism
and gaining a little elbow-room—keeping
his four tons of lorry and cargo crawling
at one and a half miles an hour was a
strain even upon the experienced Mr. Prodgers.
</p>

<p>
But he was unlucky.  As they reached
the corner of King William Street and
Cheapside, where all the traffic of the City
converges, the policeman's white-sleeved
arm went up almost under the horses'
noses.  The driver threw himself back upon
the reins, and the horses stopped, slipping
and plunging upon the glassy surface,
while Mr. Prodgers behind him fell forward
on clutch and brake and stopped his
lorry neatly with the tip of the bonnet six
inches behind the tail-board.
</p>

<p>
Philosophically, Mr. Prodgers resigned
himself to a long wait while the cross
traffic was let through.  He took the
extinguished half cigarette from behind his
ear, lit it, and filled his lungs comfortably
with smoke, while all round him, beside
him and behind him the checked stream of
vehicles piled up against this check to its
progress.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prodgers smoked very much at his
ease, surveying the rush and bustle of
London life from his high perch in the
lorry's cab.  Then suddenly all ease departed,
for a sudden cessation of vibration told
him that his engine had stopped, and this
unbelievable fact was confirmed by a
glance at the oil-pressure gauge.
</p>

<p>
"'Ell!" said Mr. Prodgers.
</p>

<p>
He pressed his foot on the self-starter
button.  There was no response whatever.
</p>

<p>
"'Ell!" said Mr. Prodgers again.  He
opened his door, flung himself down to the
ground, and jumped to the starting
handle.  If he was not ready to move on the
instant the policeman dropped his arm he
would be in trouble, and he knew it.  He
flung all his brawny weight upon the
starting handle.  He wound away with
desperation, turning the heavy engine over as
if it had been a baby car's, such was his
panic.  In this stifling heat the sweat
poured in rivers down his face, but there
was no response from the engine.  As he
wound at the handle he heard the clatter
of hoofs.  The cart in front was on the
move—traffic was being let through.
</p>

<p>
"Bloody 'ell," said Mr. Prodgers.
</p>

<p>
He had half a minute left in which to
get started, if he wanted to avoid prosecution
for obstruction.  In one last despairing
effort he flung himself again at the
starting handle, but unavailingly.  There
was no more life in that engine than there
is in a sheep's carcass in a butcher's shop.
He slowly straightened his back to wait
philosophically the arrival of the policeman.
</p>

<p>
But when he stood upright and was at
last able to take stock of his surroundings
his eyes were rejoiced with a most unusual
spectacle.  In front of all the motor
vehicles which had halted round him in
King William Street there were men
winding away wildly at the starting handles.
Mr. Prodgers momentarily experienced the
pleasure which comes of the discovery that
one's misfortunes are shared by others;
but the pleasure was immediately forgotten
in surprise at the coincidence that a
dozen motor vehicles in one place should
strike work together.
</p>

<p>
Even as Mr. Prodgers began to marvel at
this, realization came simultaneously to all
those others winding starting handles.
Everybody straightened themselves up and
stared sheepishly at each other.  Then some
of them even laughed, but the laughter
died away as the inevitable policeman
came up.
</p>

<p>
"Nar then," said the constable.  "Wot
d'you think you're up to?  Get a move on
quick, or you'll be on the peg."
</p>

<p>
At that one or two of the fainter hearts,
or those with bad traffic records, applied
themselves—uselessly once more—to the
starting handles.  But Mr. Prodgers was of
sterner stuff, and he understood that lorry
of his far better than he understood his
wife, for instance.  He knew that if it
refused to move it must be for some
substantial reason.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing doing," he said, stoically.
"Tike me nime and me number, and then
call the brikedown van."
</p>

<p>
By the usual constabulary legerdemain
pencil and notebook appeared like magic
in the policeman's hands.  Name and
number were in process of being jotted down
when the policeman's attention was
diverted.
</p>

<p>
"Officer," said an indignant voice.  "Officer.
Something must have happened."
</p>

<p>
The policeman looked around and found
at his elbow an indignant figure in the
short-coated and high-hatted uniform of
the Stock Exchange.
</p>

<p>
"Officer," said this individual, hurriedly
doing his best to minimize the absurdity
of his first obvious remark.  "All these cars
wouldn't stop like this all together if
something hadn't happened.  <i>My</i> car wouldn't
break down."
</p>

<p>
A gesture of the stockbroker's hand
indicated a long glittering black saloon a
little farther back in the press, with a
liveried chauffeur standing helplessly by
the bonnet.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
There were murmurs of agreement
here and there among the other drivers.
The policeman held his pencil suspended
over his notebook for a moment,
and then put them slowly away into his
pocket.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," he said.  "But we've got to
get you out of the way quick, or there'll be
hell to pay."
</p>

<p>
As if to accentuate his words there came
from far down King William Street a
despairing hooting as other drivers broke the
law of the land in calling attention to the
fact that they were being kept waiting.
The policeman looked round him.  In
Cornhill and Cheapside and Queen Victoria
Street and Moorgate Street there was a
wild tangle of traffic.  Everything—motor-cars,
buses, and all—was held up by the
traffic waiting to enter or emerge from
King William Street.
</p>

<p>
The policeman knew by long experience
that the results of even the slightest check
to the rush hour traffic were likely to
persist for a long time into the day.  He
foresaw himself being officially hauled over
the coals for this business.  The inevitable
crowd was forming on the pavements; in
the City of London the production of a
policeman's notebook summons more men
from the earth than ever did the dragon's
teeth.  He turned to the drivers.
</p>

<p>
"Get yourselves out of this if you can.
Push yourselves out by 'and, can't you?
Get over beyond the Bank.  I'll fix it up
with the officer on point duty."
</p>

<p>
From that moment the traffic arrangements
of the City of London collapsed into
chaos.  All round the Bank of England
people were pushing motor-cars.  Despite the
fact that the usual hundreds of people
with nothing obvious to do all fell to and
lent willing hands to help, the holding up
of the cross traffic to let the crawling
vehicles by crammed the streets for half a
mile in every direction.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prodgers, naturally, could not
contemplate the pushing of four tons of lorry
and cement by hand.  He stood and marvelled
instead, while he waited for the van
the police had sent for to come and tow
him away.  But there was more and more
to marvel at.  When fifty broken-down
motor-cars had been laboriously pushed by
hand out of the Bank end of King William
Street there came pouring up a flood of
vehicles which had been waiting down at
the London Bridge end.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prodgers saw a light delivery van,
the first of the stream, approaching from
behind his lorry.  Twenty yards back he
suddenly saw it falter in its progress.
Mr. Prodgers even noticed the change of
expression on the driver's face.  The van
rolled forward, ever more slowly, until it
came to a complete stop close to the lorry.
Mr. Prodgers found a sardonic enjoyment
in watching the driver do exactly what he
himself had done, and two score other
drivers as well—stretch out his foot for the
self-starter button, and then, finding the
self-starter out of action hurriedly climb
down and apply himself to the starting
handle.
</p>

<p>
Other vans and buses came rolling up,
and one and all stopped as they neared the
end of King William Street.  In fact, one
minute after the street cleared, save for
Mr. Prodgers' lorry, King William Street
was tightly jammed again with helpless
vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prodgers sauntered across to the
light van.
</p>

<p>
"It's no go, mate," he said to the
still-winding driver.
</p>

<p>
"What d'you mean?" answered the driver,
looking up at him.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Mr. Prodgers, dramatically,
and the driver, following his gesture
with his gaze, saw in that instant six other
drivers pressing self-starter buttons or
winding handles.
</p>

<p>
"Coo!" said the driver.
</p>

<p>
But the conversation was interrupted,
because Mr. Prodgers saw the van which
the police had sent for approaching from
Cheapside, and he had to hurry away
to welcome it.  The driver of the break-down
van, escorted by a couple of policemen
who held up the traffic, turned his
bonnet towards the Bank of England, and
then, getting into-reverse, proceeded to
back into King William Street into a
position to tow Mr. Prodgers' lorry out.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prodgers saw the back of the van
approaching him; he saw the face of the
driver peering backwards round the side.
Then the breakdown van suddenly lurched
and stopped.  The driver withdrew his head
abruptly, and Mr. Prodgers guessed he was
pressing his self-starter.  A second or two
later Mr. Prodgers saw him emerge and
jump round to the front of the van, and
Mr. Prodgers instantly guessed that he
must be turning his starting handle.
</p>

<p>
"It's something in the hair," said Mr. Prodgers
to himself, half aloud.  "It must
be something in the hair."
</p>

<p>
Chaos ruled again: There were fifty
policemen now assembled round the end of
King William Street.  There were two
thousand spectators lining the pavement.
Mr. Prodgers conferred with a police inspector
and with the team of the breakdown lorry.
Mr. Prodgers proudly enunciated his new
theory of an atmospheric disturbance.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe so," said the inspector.  "One of
those cars which wouldn't go here went
all right when they pushed it over into
Cheapside.  Didn't seem nothing wrong
with it there.  What do you think about it?"
</p>

<p>
This question was addressed to the driver
of the light delivery van, who had been
displaying prodigies of activity.  He had
whipped open his bonnet, had ascertained
that the petrol was flowing properly, that
the jet was not choked, that the carburetor
was functioning, and had then turned
his attention to the ignition.  Shading his
eyes with his hat from the strong sunlight
he peered at the points of a sparking plug
while his van boy turned the engine over.
</p>

<p>
"Not a glimmer.  Nothing' doing.  Mag's
gone scatty," said the van driver.
</p>

<p>
The experts from the breakdown van concurred.
</p>

<p>
"Mag. or no bloody mag.," said the
inspector, Napoleonically, "I've got to get
this bloody street clear.  It'll take all the
bloody day to get the bloody traffic running
properly after this.  This bloody jam"—he
indicated the packed waiting vehicles
in King William Street—"stretches from
here over the bloody bridge all the way to
St. George's bloody church."
</p>

<p>
The inspector turned away from the
little group, his mind made up for him by
this burst of eloquence.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Marvell," he said.
</p>

<p>
A sweating police sergeant turned towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Get down to the Monument," said the
inspector.  "Take six—no, ten—men with
you.  Divert everything there.  Nothing
more's to come up King William Street
until further orders.  Stuff going west'll have
to go up Cannon Street.  Send everything
else up Gracechurch Street.  Get on with it."
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Marvell departed, the string of
constables with him shouldering their way
through the packed crowds.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," continued the inspector to
himself, "horses haven't got mags.  Where's
a telephone?"
</p>

<p>
It was by the aid of four horses sent up
by a wondering police headquarters that
in the end Mr. Prodgers' lorry was towed away.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, of course, an exasperated
clerk of the works on duty at the place
where the new offices were in the course
of erection in Finsbury Pavement was
cursing madly to himself at the
non-arrival of the two tons of cement which
Mr. Prodgers was supposed to bring up.
</p>

<p>
The suspension of the building on
Finsbury Pavement was only one of the results
of Dr. Pethwick's activities.  Those results
spread far and wide—the only satisfactory
metaphor which can be employed is the
old one of the ripples caused by throwing
a stone into a pond.  Because of what
Dr. Pethwick had done, some hundreds of City
men were late for their appointments, and
even City men's appointments are of some
value.  Some hundreds of City messenger
boys who stopped to see the fun were late
in delivering their messages and those
messages were presumably of some value,
too.  Goods which were urgently expected
arrived late.  There was delay and muddle
and exasperation throughout the City.
</p>

<p>
And not only in the City, either.  Far
out in the suburbs, in Brixton and
Homerton, wherever a motor-bus route
penetrated after passing through the City,
housewives waited in vain for the buses
to arrive which would carry them home
from their shopping expeditions, while the
buses themselves were either laboriously
towed to the company's repair depots or,
jammed wheel to wheel in a never-ending
queue, were crawling at the pace of a snail
through the over-congested streets into
which they had been diverted.
</p>

<p>
In hotels travellers with a train to catch
waited in vain for their laundry.  In
restaurants cooks waited in vain for their
chops and steaks.  In magazine offices the
printers waited in vain for the arrival of
the advertisers' blocks.  The City police
worked overtime; City clerks whose
windows overlooked the tumult did not work
at all.
</p>

<p>
The whole activity of London—of England,
in fact—was deranged by Dr. Pethwick's
interference with the traffic.  He had
chosen his weapon well.  Just as a slight
pressure on the carotid artery will make
a human being dizzy, so did Dr. Pethwick's
pressure on an artery of the City
cause equivalent trouble.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick had as a rule little taste
for crowds.  He was rarely moved by
vulgar curiosity; he never dreamt of
stopping to join the idle onlookers around
a fallen horse or watching men working
pneumatic drills.  But on that August
morning he joined the crowds who seethed
round the end of King William Street.
His tall lean figure in its elegant suit was
to be seen there, making slow progress
through the mob.  Mr. Prodgers saw him,
and the police inspector, but they naturally
did not think their troubles were due
to this individual who bore all the
hallmarks of prosperity and neutrality.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick saw a good deal.  He saw
the breakdown van which had come to tow
away Mr. Prodgers' lorry cease work when
it came under the influence of the
Klein-Pethwick Effect.  He saw the stockbroker's
car—which had coil ignition—start up
again in response to a despairing trial by
the chauffeur when it had been pushed
beyond that influence into Cheapside.  For
with coil ignition the Klein-Pethwick
Effect could only operate while the vehicle
was actually in its range.
</p>

<p>
Once the car was removed, the soft iron
core of the coil could once more be
magnetized by the current from the accumulator
circulating round it; a spark could
once more pass, and the car could proceed
as if nothing had happened.  It was only
those vehicles with magneto ignition which
suffered permanent damage.  In these cases
the spark had to be produced by the
rotation of a coil of wire in a magnetic field
due to a permanent magnet, and when the
permanent magnet had lost its magnetism
the only way to get the vehicles into
running order again was to take out the
magneto and either remagnetize the
magnet or—what was no dearer—replace the
whole instrument with a new one.  That
was hard luck on the owners of motor
vehicles with magneto ignition which came
under the influence of the Klein-Pethwick
Effect, but Dr. Pethwick felt no concern—at
present, anyway—for cases of individual
hardship.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick saw the banked-up traffic,
and the convulsions that ensued upon
trying to clear away the broken-down
vehicles.  He realized that his setting of his
instrument had not been quite as accurate
as it might have been.  He had only barred
King William Street traffic, and though
this might cause a good deal of trouble,
the trouble could be avoided to a large
extent by diverting all traffic—as the police
inspector now proposed to do—from the
street.
</p>

<p>
Humanity is a good deal more educable
than flies are, even though the recent
history of humanity might make this seem
improbable.  A fly encountering a window
pane will refuse to believe in the existence
of a transparent substance impervious to
flies, however forcibly the fact is
demonstrated to him by the bumps his nose
receives when he flies against the pane.  It
only took three bad jams at the mouth of
King William Street to convince the
authorities that for some reason which they
could not imagine, and which they had
never before encountered, King William
Street was unsuitable that day for motor
traffic.  It was unfortunate for them that
they reached this decision just when
Dr. Pethwick was making his way back to
Hammer Court through the crowds.
</p>

<p>
Hammer Court, when Dr. Pethwick
reached it, appeared just the same as ever.
It was quite unchanged by the fact that
history was being made a hundred yards
away.  Dr. Pethwick strolled across the
yard—his chest out a little under the
influence of the double-breasted coat—and
in through the door at the corner and
down the dark staircase to his office.
</p>

<p>
He took the precaution of looking round
before unlocking the door; it was just
possible that someone might hear the buzz
of the make-and-break when the door
was open if he were standing near.
Dr. Pethwick entered quickly and locked the
door behind him; on the table the
make-and-break was still buzzing in its low
monotone—not nearly as noisy as the
typewriters on the floor above—and the dull
glow from the emitter was still evident.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick had guessed the cause of the
slight error in laying his emitter.  His
compass did not indicate the exact magnetic
north; even in a City office there must be
a certain amount of deflection caused by
iron piping in the walls and similar
objects.  But as he had reached a result by
experiment there was no need for tedious
correction, even if that were possible with
the instruments at his disposition.  A very
brief calculation in solid trigonometry
sufficed.  Across the line on the paper on
the table he drew another one, at a very
slight angle.  Then he rotated his emitter
until the instrument was exactly parallel
to the new line.
</p>

<p>
It certainly was not Mr. Prodgers' lucky
day.  He had reported the surprising
misadventure which had overtaken his lorry
to the clerk of the works at Finsbury
Pavement, and now he was on his way
back to the yard to bring up the reserve
lorry—a prehistoric Ford which he hated—seated
beside the driver of an empty lorry
returning to refill.
</p>

<p>
They came out round the Bank of England
from Princes Street; the police were
diverting all traffic bound for London
Bridge through Lombard Street and
Gracechurch Street.  But as the lorry came
lumbering out into the open space on which
the Duke of Wellington looks down with
his sightless bronze eyes—the very point
which a taxicab driver had once described
to Dr. Pethwick as "the 'eart and center
of the City"—the lorry slowed up abruptly,
just as if someone had switched off the
ignition.
</p>

<p>
"Gawd lumme!" said Mr. Prodgers.
"We've got 'em again."
</p>

<p>
He put out a restraining hand and
stopped his mate from precipitating
himself down from the driver's cab to turn
the starting handle.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Mr. Prodgers.
"There's plenty like us."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
From their position of vantage, stationary
midway in the triangle made by the
Royal Exchange, the Bank of England,
and the Mansion House, they had a clear
view of all the streets which center upon
the spot—Cheapside and Queen Victoria
Street and Princes Street and Cornhill and
Lombard Street and Threadneedle Street
to say nothing of the now deserted King
William Street.  And wherever they turned
their eyes, at each waiting queue of traffic
in turn, there were people trying to start
motor cars that obstinately refused to go.
All round them, on the central crossing
itself, there were other vehicles in the
same condition.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick had laid his instruments
correctly enough now.  Where before he
had merely been pressing on an artery,
he now had checked the action of the
heart.  It would not be a matter of an hour
or two; it would take all day and all night
to clear up the difficulties so caused.  The
Klein-Pethwick Effect emerged from the
emitter underground in Hammer Court in
a cone of dispersion, and the conic section
just above ground level outside the Royal
Exchange was an ellipse something over a
hundred yards along the major axis and
something under that amount wide.  Practically
all the area covered by that ellipse—of
a superficial area of some nine
thousand square yards—was crammed with
motor traffic.
</p>

<p>
The police were presented now with the
problem of getting some two hundred
broken-down motor vehicles out of the
way.  When they should have done that,
they would next have to face a situation
whereby every important road in the City
of London was barred.  All the precious
half square mile centering round the Bank
of England, where the freehold value of
a single square foot of land is equal to a
working man's income for a couple of
years, was endangered by the complete
cessation of all cross traffic.
</p>

<p>
Society from the days of the Romans
at least had been dependent on ease of
communication; within the last thirty
years there had grown up a new dependence
upon motor vehicles.  Dr. Pethwick
was injuring society at its most tender
point.
</p>

<p>
He himself, however, at the moment, was
not very immediately concerned about all
this.  He was occupied with writing a letter,
seated at the typewriting table which
Mr. Freeman had sold him, with his apparatus
buzzing away at his elbow on the big
table.  He was writing with care, employing
the same script of Roman capitals which
he had used when he wrote his previous
letter to the Editor of <i>The Times</i>.  It took
him a long time; perhaps a little more
than two hours.  When he had finished it,
he folded it into a long envelope which
he addressed as before and laid it aside.
Then with one long slender finger he
switched off the current, and by that single
movement made life possible once more
in the City of London.
</p>

<p>
He dismantled his apparatus, and locked
it away again in the cupboard.  He was
about to take his hat and his letter and
start out when he suddenly remembered
that he was still wearing his beautiful
suit; if he had not realized this he might
have gone home and displayed himself in
all his glory to Mary and so ruined all
his plans.  He changed his clothes hurriedly,
grabbed his letter, and came out of
Hammer Court, a shabby, rather insignificant man.
</p>

<p>
The streets seethed with people.  There
were harassed policemen everywhere, and
there were broken-down motor-cars and
buses parked along the kerbs in every
street.  Dr. Pethwick thought of posting his
letter, made a rapid calculation of time
and space, and decided on delivering it
himself.  He had not the remotest idea
where Printing House Square might be,
but by a piece of deduction which would
have been surprising in him a fortnight
ago he decided that it must be near Fleet
Street, and so walked down Queen Victoria
Street in that direction.  New Bridge
Street, too, was full of policemen, busily
diverting the traffic which wished to go
City-wards, warning all east-bound traffic
to keep to Cannon Street and Fenchurch
Street, and sending everything which
aimed more north than that along the
weary round through Aldersgate Street
and Old Street.
</p>

<p>
A messenger boy told Dr. Pethwick where
to find Printing House Square, and
Dr. Pethwick with his own hand dropped his
letter into the solid brass letter-box of
<i>The Times</i>.  When he came back into
Queen Victoria Street he noticed the
posters which the boys who sold the evening
newspapers were displaying.  The very
sight of their wording sent a thrill through
him; he felt a hot flush beneath his skin.
"Amazing Traffic Scenes in City," said
one.  "Traffic Breakdown.  What Experts
Think," said another, while the third
pinned its faith to a more generalized
expression and merely announced "Sensation
in City."
</p>

<p>
It illustrates the oddity of human nature
that the sight of these contents bills
should rouse Dr. Pethwick to excitement
in the way it did, while he had been so
little moved when with his own eyes he
had seen the actual results of his actions.
His hand trembled a little as he searched
for a penny and bought a paper.  There
were flaring headlines right across the
front page; half the remainder of the
front page displayed a photograph taken
of the traffic crossing in front of the
Royal Exchange, showing horses busily
engaged in pulling motor-buses out of the
way.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick was so interested in reading
all about it that he collided over and
over again with people walking in the
street.
</p>

<p>
The fifth collision was such a severe one
that it shook him into a half-dazed condition;
when he recovered he made himself
put his paper in his pocket while he walked
to the station.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Once in the train, he read with avidity.
The newspaper he had bought happened
to be the one which had displayed
"What Experts Think" on its contents
bill, and when Dr. Pethwick glanced down
this column he realized what an amazing
amount of balderdash experts think.
</p>

<p>
There was some excuse for them, of
course.  Half of them had been rung up
on the telephone and had been asked for
their opinion the moment they had been
given a very inaccurate account of the
facts.  Most of the reporters had been misled
by irrelevant details—because in a good
many cases the drivers of vehicles under
the influence of the Klein-Pethwick Effect
had pressed their self-starter switches for
an absurdly long time.  And as the rotation
of a starting motor depends on magnetism,
the motors had refused to rotate, and in
that case much heavier currents passed
through the coils than passed when the
motor was in motion, with the result that
dynamotor coils were burnt out, and
accumulator plates buckled, and the whole
electrical apparatus of the motor-car,
ruined even in cases where, having coil
ignition, the whole damage done might
have been merely temporary if the drivers
had used moderation.
</p>

<p>
These crumpled accumulator plates and
burnt-out insulations had naturally
claimed as much attention as, or even
more than, any temporary difficulty with
a spark coil, and excited newspaper men,
pouring out on the telephone to bewildered
scientists a whole mass of information,
true and false, misleading and otherwise,
had elicited the most amazing suggestions.
By the time these suggestions had
been scribbled down in shorthand by
someone with no scientific knowledge
whatever, transcribed by someone with even
less, set up in type and proofread in a
hurry by people whose ignorance of scientific
terminology is proverbial, the result
was extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
The great Norbury had given an opinion—of
course; no scientific article in the
evening press would be complete without
Norbury—and had apparently hazarded a
guess that atmospheric electricity might
be the cause of the trouble.  Presumably
Norbury had said something about "Lightning,
you know, is one result of atmospheric
electricity," while trying to make
himself clear over a defective telephone,
and the result was that there was a
cross-heading in the article to the effect that
"Famous Scientist suggests Lightning as
a Cause."  On the other hand, Dodgson,
the constructional engineer—who knew no
more about electricity than a schoolboy—had
come a little nearer the mark in the
half-dozen wild shots he made when he
suggested that perhaps someone experimenting
with a new form of beam wireless
was responsible for the damage.
</p>

<p>
The most honest opinion was given in
the opening words of an interview with
a prominent manufacturer of motor-cars,
who began with: "I simply cannot understand
it."  It was inevitable, all the same,
that he should go on with: "But as far
as I can make out very few of our cars
were affected."
</p>

<p>
In the crowded railway carriage there
was actually a new topic of conversation
to replace the discussion of the prevailing
heat, which had done duty for three weeks
now.  Men were exchanging their impressions
of the traffic block, and their theories
of its cause—and most of these theories
were no wilder than those put forward
in the paper Dr. Pethwick held.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick found it all so exciting
that he almost forgot to get out of the
train when it arrived at his station; he
just managed to precipitate himself down
from the door, after treading on half a
dozen feet on his way to it, just as the train
began to move off again.  The guard
shouted at him; the porter looked at him
disapprovingly; the people on the platform
turned and stared.  But for once in his life
Dr. Pethwick was unmoved by publicity.
He noticed none of it as, clutching his
paper, he made his way to the station exit.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick retained enough of the
keen practical sense which had carried
him through so far to endeavor to make
himself at least appear normal when he
reached home.  But Mary, even though,
after a long day with her friends, she was
not quite as perceptive as she might have
been, could not help but notice something
a little strange about him.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished his meal he
plunged once more into re-reading the
evening paper.  And, now she came to
think of it, his glances had strayed over
to that paper several times during the
meal—and yet the paper bore every sign
of having been well read already.  Later
on, when he put it down at last, she was
able to take possession of it and look
through it herself.  She could see nothing
in it to account for this new manner.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she formed a theory that
he might have drawn a big prize in a
sweepstake, but there was nothing about
sweepstakes, and no list of prize-winners.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see anything of this traffic jam
they talk about here?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Pethwick.  He was ready
for anything now.  "It held me up a bit
when I was coming back across London."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it wasn't nearly as bad as
they say," sniffed Mary.  "You can never
believe anything you read in the papers
nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was pretty bad," said Pethwick,
calmly.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
During the night the newspapers
had plenty of time to make up
their minds about the City traffic
jam.  Whatever it was which had been
holding up the traffic ended its activity
some time later in the afternoon—some
time after four o'clock.  That was certain,
for when a car-load of scientists obtained
police permission to make experiments,
and drove gaily into the road junction
outside the Royal Exchange, at twenty
minutes past four they were sadly disappointed
to find that their car did not stop, but
travelled from Cheapside to Cornhill.
</p>

<p>
They were left lamenting, with no data
to go on save what could be obtained by
examination of the helpless cars which
were by now distributed in repairing
garages all round London.
</p>

<p>
One or two of the saner newspapers were
able to produce quite a good analysis of
the course of events.  They were able to
work out how the phenomenon had manifested
itself first at the end of King William
Street and, after persisting there for
an hour and a half, from about 10 a.m.
to 11:30, had suddenly shifted itself fifty
yards into the main street junction.
</p>

<p>
After that, however, opinion was very
sharply divided.  To some minds the
conclusion was obvious, that the trouble was
due to a human agency, which had first
made a bad shot before correcting its aim
and settling down upon the most sensitive
area (from a traffic point of view) in all
London.
</p>

<p>
But other newspapers could not bring
themselves to believe this.  For one thing,
they flinched from facing the important
conclusion that if it were true some person
or persons had London's traffic at their
mercy.  For another, they formed a
muddled picture of what had happened.
</p>

<p>
The disjointed narratives of various
eye-witnesses seemed to indicate a repeated
shifting of the scene of the disturbance—over
a small area, it is true, but a shifting
all the same.  These newspapers decided
after much cogitation to give their opinion
in favour of some sort of electrical
disturbance or other, which by pure chance
had focused itself on the point where it
would be most felt.  After all, as Norbury
wrote in an article on a leader page,
there could have been electrical storms
affecting magnetos in the Sahara since
the world first took shape without anyone
knowing of them, because there were no
magnetos in the Sahara.  Perhaps this
recent scorching hot summer in England,
and perhaps—Norbury put the suggestion
forward with unwonted diffidence—new
recent electrical methods in England,
broadcasting for instance, or the new
high-tension grid system all over the
country—had brought about some conditions never
reproduced before.
</p>

<p>
It was all a little wild, but Norbury could
write well, and he was able to mask most
of the weak points in his argument from
the not very intelligent mass of his
readers by a skilful vagueness.  Norbury
himself, if the truth must be told, had
hesitated for one delirious moment over plunging
for a hypothesis that the phenomenon
might be due to an attempt by sentient
beings on some other planet to attract
the attention of mankind.  That really
seemed as likely to him as the event he
was discussing, but he decided in the end
to play for safety.
</p>

<p>
As regards the newspapers who decided
in favor of human agency, there was
further divergence of opinion as regards the
motive behind the act.  It might be a
practical joke, or it might be the act of a
man trying to call attention to some new
invention.  It might—of course—be due to
the machinations of Communists subsidised
with Russian gold.  It might be a
trial effort on the part of some potentially
hostile power, or it might be due to
inadvertence on the part of government
experts employed in testing secret weapons.
</p>

<p>
In fact, all the way up and down Fleet
Street that night there was long and
anxious debate.  Some editors—or
proprietors—were for plumping for one theory,
some for another.  And as no one knew
what new development, if any, to expect
next day, everyone wanted to play for
safety, only to be brought up against the
fact that some theory or other must be
put forward to satisfy their readers, who
had been carefully educated not to think
for themselves.  Editors everywhere were
saying as usual, "Who would sell a farm
and be an editor?"—and in this case they
almost began to mean it.
</p>

<p>
Yet meanwhile, all the time that these
hectic decisions were being made in Fleet
Street, there was quite another development
in Printing House Square.  Somebody
was reading a letter which had been
delivered by hand in the course of the
afternoon.  Somebody scratched his head,
looked up at the ceiling to refresh his
memory, and finally went over to the
"waiting" file and found another letter
in the same disguised handwriting.  Somebody
at last decided to risk it and take the
two letters in to higher authority.
</p>

<p>
Higher authority heard the facts,
hurriedly read the two letters and the long
duplicate enclosed with the second and
tugged his chin as he tried to make up
his mind.  In the end higher authority
went in to the highest authority of all,
and told him all about it, and ended up
with the words, "I think there's something
in it."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Highest authority of all read the three
documents, and hesitated long over
them.  <i>The Times</i> has a sense of
responsibility towards its readers, and it also feels
a sensitiveness regarding forgeries and
unsubstantiated letters dating back to the
time of Pigott's forgery of the Parnell
letters.  But there was something about
the letters which were now under
consideration which bore the stamp of truth.
And if they were true <i>The Times</i> had a
scoop, a watertight, brass-bound,
copper-bottomed scoop of the kind every
journalist—even those attached to <i>The
Times</i>—dreams about in optimistic moments.
</p>

<p>
"You know what we ought to do with
these if they're what you think they are?"
said the highest authority of all.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," said the other, quite
understanding, all the same.
</p>

<p>
"They ought to go to the police."
</p>

<p>
"The police?  But—but—the fellow hasn't
done anything the police can take cognizance
of, has he?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's caused an obstruction.  The
blighters ran me in for that last week
when I left my car for five minutes in
Holborn.  Anyway, it's silly to deny they're
after him, or would be, if they thought he
existed.  You know that as well as I do.
They ought to be told."
</p>

<p>
Yet despite these eminently sensible
conclusions, there was a look on both their
faces which seemed to belie their spoken
words.
</p>

<p>
"The police?" repeated the younger man,
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
Lesser newspapers than <i>The Times</i> were
on intimate terms with the police.  News
as important as this would leak out for
certain, and where would that scoop be
then?  The old <i>Times</i> deserved a scoop,
if anyone did.  The junior editor's face
fell; his disappointment was obvious.  His
senior saw his expression, and made up
his mind then and there.
</p>

<p>
"We'll publish," he said, his jaw coming
forward.  "And we won't let the police see
these until four o'clock tomorrow morning.
You see to that; it ought to be safe enough
then.  We'll be compounding a felony, but
we can't help that.  And if we publish at
all, we've got to give it prominence.  It's
taking a chance, but—  We'll have to have
a leader on it.
</p>

<p>
"Send Bumblethwaite in to me.  And
Harriman.  You'll have to scrap that article
of Macfarlane's on the scientific point of
view.  He's barking up the wrong tree if
this is true, and God send it is.  I'll be
going out of this office on my ear if it isn't,
and so will you, young man, agreement
or no agreement.  Get going on some sort
of introduction for this stuff.  You'd better
do that yourself.  Come back in half an
hour."
</p>

<p>
So that next morning when Dr. Pethwick
opened his <i>Times</i> at the breakfast table
the first thing that caught his eye was a
fat column headed "London Traffic
Obstruction.  A Manifesto."  Dr. Pethwick
allowed his boiled egg to grow cold while
he read the article.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Yesterday afternoon we received the
following letter which was delivered by
hand at approximately 4:30 p.m.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
To the Editor of <i>The Times</i>.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Dear Sir,</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I notice that you have not published my
letter of the 28th.  That was only to be
expected, but I hope you will now see your
way to publishing it in your next issue,
because the present condition of London
traffic is sufficient proof of what that
letter stated.  As a further proof, traffic
will be impeded in another part of London
for a short period following 10:30 a.m. to-morrow,
July 30th.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  <i>Yours truly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacemaker.</i><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>P.S.—I enclose a copy of my letter of the
28th in case you have mislaid the original.</i>
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
On investigation (the article went
on) it was found that, on the evening
of the 28th the following letter addressed
to the Editor had been received.  This had
been posted at noon in the London E.C. district.
We make no apology for not having
published it earlier, because, as our
readers will agree, it appeared to be the
work of an irresponsible person.  But,
considered now in the light of recent events,
it appears possible that the writer has
the power he claims, and we therefore
reproduce his letter below.  We can only
add that both letters are written in a
disguised hand, and a photographic
reproduction of a part of one of the letters
appears on page 14.  The originals are
now in the possession of the police.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
To the Editor of <i>The Times</i>:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Dear Sir,</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A method has been discovered, whereby
it is possible to cause a magnet to lose its
magnetism at a point a very considerable
distance from the instrument used.  This
applies not merely to permanent magnets,
but to electro-magnets as well.  As a result
of this, it is now possible to stop the
working of all machines which depend on the
practical application of electro-magnetic
phenomena.  For instance, if a motor-car
is submitted to this treatment, the spark,
which is caused by the electric current
induced in a conductor under the influence
of a changing magnetic field, ceases to be
produced, and the vehicle will stop.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>If the motor-car obtains its spark by
use of an induction coil, there will be no
permanent harm done, and the vehicle
will be free to move as soon as it ceases
to be under the influence of the effect.  In
the case of a magneto it will be found that
the permanent magnet has become demagnetized,
and in that case it will be necessary
to replace the magneto by a new one
or to remagnetize the magnet before the
vehicle is again available for use.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>It will be noticed that this suggestion
is of a destructive nature.  It is extremely
likely that there may be applications of
this invention which may be of benefit to
the world, but the present suggestion
cannot be considered in that light.  It will
be noticed also that the first thought called
up by this suggestion concerns the
application of the invention to warfare, to
impede the progress of aeroplanes,
warships and tanks.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The discoverer, however, has decided
that he would not be pleased to see his
invention used in war.  He is aware of the
argument that this invention would tend
to make war more humane by hindering
the flight, for instance, of bombing
aeroplanes, but he is not convinced by it.  What
he knows of war seems to prove to him
that any attempt to make war more
humane is based on unsound data, and that
such attempts lead only to hypocrisy.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>He also believes that the occurrence of
war is facilitated, and its likelihood
increased, by the existence of armaments.
He believes it to be obvious that money
is expended on armaments which could be
put to better use.  He also believes that
armaments are maintained at present
contrary to the wishes of the majority of
people.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>In view of these facts, he has decided to
make use of his invention to bring about
a reduction in armaments.  He is aware
that conferences have been held to
consider this matter, but he believes that in
most cases they were not inspired by the
necessary sincerity.  Consequently, he
proposes to interfere with the traffic of
London, and, if necessary, to proceed to
further action, until a sincere effort has been
made to reduce the armaments maintained
by the world to the lowest point consistent
with the policing of the countries concerned.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  <i>Yours truly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacemaker.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The queer flush of excitement which
Pethwick experienced did not subside
easily.  It was not the first time that he had
seen writings of his in print—the <i>British
Journal of Physics</i> had published half a
dozen contributions from his pen—but the
thrill was still new.
</p>

<p>
He tried to criticize his compositions
cold-bloodedly.  He was aware that there
was a touch of the melodramatic about
that pseudonym of his, but what could
he have done otherwise?  He had written
the "Yours truly" before it occurred to
him that he had to put something after
it, and "Peacemaker" was quite in the
tradition of <i>Times</i> pseudonyms.  It was as
good as "Paterfamilias" or "Amicus
Curiae" any day of the week.  For the rest,
Pethwick could not consider it too bad.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick was no literary man; he could
not realize the painful effect which might
be produced by his laconic sentences.  A
more skilful writer might have contrived
to gild the pill a little, to have wrapped up
the bald threat in a trifle of verbiage.  But
that was not Pethwick's way.  He wanted
disarmament.  He believed he could
enforce it.  It had been difficult to describe
his invention in terms that could be
understood by unscientific people; to state
his whole project in courtly terms would
have been impossible to him even if he
had realized the necessity.
</p>

<p>
He ran his eye down the columns
describing traffic conditions in London
yesterday, and then turned the pages more
aimlessly, until his eye caught sight of
the leader which Messrs. Bumblethwaite
and Harriman had constructed with care.
It was a shock to him.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Somehow Dr. Pethwick had conjured
up a vague picture of himself as spokesman
for a majority.  He sincerely believed
that by far the greater proportion of
humanity would be glad if armaments
were abolished, and he had fancied that
this announcement of his would be hailed
with pleasure.  He had actually imagined
that people would say, "What fools we were
not to think of this before," and that in
a week or two the whole business would
be settled, and governments would be
looking round for suitable purposes on which
to spend the half of their budgets which
would be on their hands now that they
were not spending it on armies and navies.
That was his conception of how events
would move, even if he had not specifically
framed it in such words.
</p>

<p>
His own logical mind was so struck by
the absurdity of spending money on
armaments that he could not conceive of
anyone hesitating, save through sheer inertia,
to dispense with them.  If any difficulties
at all were to be raised, he had assumed
vaguely that they might occur somewhere
in the distant Balkans, perhaps, where a
reactionary government or two might hold
out for a space before having to give way
before the united demands of their peoples
and the economic pressure of the rest of
Europe.  He only visualized himself as the
man who gave the initial tap which started
the ball rolling.
</p>

<p>
But <i>The Times</i> leader disillusioned him.
It spoke about "Peacemaking extraordinary."  It
spoke about "fanatics" and "unconstitutional
methods."  The only caution
it displayed was due to a lingering doubt
that the two letters from "Peacemaker"
might be spurious—it prefaced its
whole-hearted condemnation of the scheme with
a cautious "if at ten-thirty today we are
confronted with proof—"  Apart from that
it simply went for Dr. Pethwick
whole-heartedly, using much the same language
as had once been employed to describe
the men who organized the General Strike.
It went on to describe "Peacemaker's"
activities as undoubtedly criminal, and it
expressed a hope that they would be cut
short, promptly and effectively, by the
police.
</p>

<p>
It offered cordial sympathy to all those
who had suffered loss yesterday from
"Peacemaker's" lunatic behavior.  The
leader ended up with the inevitable bit of
lip-service to the cause of peace—the
mealy-mouthed admission that peace and
disarmament were the dearest wish of
every thinking person—but "actions of this
sort discredit the whole movement in
favor of disarmament, and only tend to
defeat the object which 'Peacemaker'
professes to be anxious to achieve."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick read that leader with a growing
uneasiness, and when he read it again
the uneasiness grew into indignation; by
the time the second reading was finished
he was in a state as near to berserk anger
as one of his mild temperament could be.
He glanced up at the clock on the
mantel-piece.  At ten-thirty <i>The Times</i> would be
confronted with all the proof they needed.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered his cold egg, and he
looked across the table to find Mary's eyes
on him.
</p>

<p>
"Go on and eat your breakfast," said
Mary.  "You're keeping me hanging about
when I've got such a lot to do."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick dug his spoon into his egg as
if the viscous yolk were the heart of <i>The
Times's</i> leader-writer.  He controlled
himself as well as he could, gulping down the
luke-warm stuff, and remembering to take
bites of his bread and butter—as a child
when he had been given an egg the rule
had been "one little bite of egg and two
bites of bread and butter."  He drank his
cold tea and looked up at the clock again.
</p>

<p>
"I want to go to town again today," he
said, as casually as he could, and when he
met Mary's eyes he read in them the
expression he dreaded.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want to go up there for?"
she said.  "I was going to have a nice
dinner today—there a joint coming.  You
won't be back to dinner, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Mary had noticed his agitation.  She
had noticed those glances of his at the
clock.  Suspicions were beginning to
germinate within her, and anyway she was in
the mood to oppose anything Pethwick
wanted to do merely because he wanted
to do it.  Pethwick tried to put forward the
excuse which had served well enough up
to now.
</p>

<p>
"The University Library!" sneered Mary.
"What do you want to do at the University
Library?"
</p>

<p>
Pethwick sighed.  He tried mildly to
explain the hypothetical research he was
thinking of undertaking.
</p>

<p>
"Can't it wait till tomorrow?" demanded
Mary.  "I was going to have nice 'ot
mutton and roast potatoes today.  Isn't that
good enough for your lordship?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's have it this evening," said
Pethwick.  He thought for a moment that the
suggestion was a beautiful piece of tactics,
but in fact it only added fuel to the flame.
</p>

<p>
"Have it this evening!" declaimed Mary.
"Your lordship wants late dinner now, I
suppose.  I'm to slave all through the heat
this afternoon, just because you want to
be like your grand friends, your Dorothy
Laxton and so on, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
Mary meant that shaft to hurt and it
did.  She saw Pethwick wince.  Pethwick
pushed back his chair, and rose to his feet,
his long gangling length towering over
the table.  Mary looked at his face again,
and for a moment she was afraid.  His
mouth was shut in a hard line, and his
eyes had a stormy brightness.  It seemed
as if the endeavours of ten years were
about to bear fruit, and Mary was to
succeed in making her husband lose his
temper.  She thought he was going to strike
her, and she felt a mad pleasure mingle
with her fear.
</p>

<p>
But there was always that clock on the
mantelpiece.  Mary's powers of intuition
enabled her to sense how her husband
thrust his rage back with a powerful
hand.  She did not know the motives which
were influencing him; she had no knowledge
of the pressing need of something to
be done in Hammer Court at ten-thirty
that morning.  All Mary knew was that
her husband suddenly pulled himself
upright and turned away without a word.
She heard him take his hat down from the
stand in the hall, and open the street door.
As he went out she rushed after him and
tore the door open again, standing on
the threshold with her dressing-gown
hanging round her.
</p>

<p>
"Ed!" she called.  "What time are you
going to be back, Ed?"
</p>

<p>
But Dr. Pethwick was striding off down
the street as fast as his ungainly legs
would carry him toward the station.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
There were trains to London Bridge
every twenty minutes, and Dr. Pethwick
missed the 9:31 by one minute, thanks
to the cumulative effect of a late
breakfast, a prolonged reading of <i>The Times</i>,
and an argument with his wife.  He
fretted and fumed upon the platform.  He
hardly paid attention to the fact that
every one of the contents bills displayed
upon the platform made some reference
to yesterday's traffic conditions in London.
He had promised to bring those conditions
about again at 10:30 today, and he felt
instinctively that it would produce a bad
moral effect if the Peacemaker should
prove to be guilty of a human weakness
like unpunctuality—and unpunctuality,
anyway, always irritated him.
</p>

<p>
He fidgeted restlessly when the 9:51 at
last took him up to London Bridge,
looking repeatedly at his watch.  When he
reached the terminus at 10:08 he discarded
the idea he had momentarily entertained
of taking a taxicab, and climbed instead
upon a less inconspicuous bus.  At 10:16
he was hurrying into Hammer Court.  Once
in his office he began to work feverishly.
</p>

<p>
With map, rule, and compass he laid off
a new line upon his horizontal sheet of
paper.  With plumb-line and protractor he
marked a new line upon his vertical sheet.
Then, without bustle, but without wasting
a moment, he brought his apparatus out
of its locked cupboard, and made the
connections with quick, steady fingers.
Straightening up when his work was done,
he pulled out his watch and reached for
the switch.  It was exactly 10:30 when he
closed the circuit, and on the instant motor
traffic in Cannon Street came to an abrupt
halt.
</p>

<p>
In all the newspaper offices of London
there had been tension that morning.
Someone in high authority had been
sitting at his desk in Printing House Square
since ten o'clock, too excited even to
grumble at the fate which had brought
him to his office at this unconscionable
hour.  He had done nothing in the half
hour he had been waiting, but as
ten-thirty came near he began to tap
nervously on his desk with his pencil.  When at
last his desk telephone rang he started
nervously.  Then he reached for the instrument.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," said the receiver to his
ear.  "He's done it.  Cannon Street at
ten-thirty.  On time to the second."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" said the man in high authority.
</p>

<p>
The good old <i>Times</i> had the biggest
scoop of the century.  This business might
have made the paper the laughing-stock
of Fleet Street if it had proved to be a
hoax, but the Peacemaker had been as
good as his word.  Telephone bells were
shrilling in the offices of the evening
papers, and there excited editors heard
the news gabbled out to them by excited
reporters, and, ringing off abruptly, had
sent excited orders down to the printing
presses, where the printers had been
standing by with a special edition ready
to set up.
</p>

<p>
In twenty minutes the papers were on
the streets.  The vans were racing through
London hurling out great bundles to the
newsboys, and excited City men were
tearing the damp copies from the newsboys'
fingers.  "Text of the Peacemaker's
Manifesto!"  "Who is the Peacemaker?"  "Peacemaker's
New Mischief!"
</p>

<p>
Oh, it was the finest scoop <i>The Times</i>
could remember.  Every single newspaper
in England had to relax its rule never to
mention the name of another newspaper.
Every one had to quote <i>The Times</i>; in
twenty-four hours the paper received more
publicity than during the last twelve-month.
People had to buy <i>The Times</i> to
learn the facts of the delivery of the
Peacemaker's letters, and to see the
facsimile reproduction of his handwriting,
even though other papers quoted the
letters verbatim.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick saw the special editions
out for sale when he walked down to
Cannon Street to see that everything was
as it should be.  He bought one and looked
at the headlines as he was jostled in the
crowd.  He himself would never have
dreamed of calling that letter of his a
"manifesto," but the newspapers seemed
determined upon it.  There was not much
chance of reading more than the
headlines, for the crowd was so dense.
</p>

<p>
The news had gone round the City
that the Peacemaker was at work now in
Cannon Street, and pens had been flung
down and typewriters abandoned while
all the City came pouring out to see.  There
was no more to see, actually, than yesterday;
only a cordon of police diverting
traffic, and broken down lorries being
pushed into side streets, and vehicles lucky
enough to have coil ignition being shoved
out of the area over which the Klein-Pethwick
Effect was being distributed.
</p>

<p>
Someone in charge of London's traffic
arrangements had been ready for the
emergency, clearly.  Cannon Street was not
an important link in the chain of London
streets.  Diversion of traffic from it did
not upset all London, especially when
prompt measures were taken to prevent
jamming, and horses were ready to hand
to deal with the heavy stuff.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick saw what little the crowd
and the police would permit him to see; it
was enough to show him that the Klein-Pethwick
Effect was not causing much
inconvenience—-and he had not realized that
so much of the Cannon Street traffic was
horsedrawn.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick turned away from the scene
thinking deeply.  He found it difficult to
decide on the next move; not until he got
back to his office and paced up and down
the crowded room for a few minutes did
he form any resolution.  The present
demonstration had not been very convincing.
He would devote a few minutes to showing
how much power he really had.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick made further calculations,
each one resulting in a new line being
drawn on his two sheets of paper, and
then, standing his emitter on the point of
intersection, he revolved it slowly, keeping
it stationary on each line in turn for three
minutes.  And as he turned it, so did traffic
come to a halt, first in Cheapside, and
then in Princes Street, and then in Cornhill,
and then in King William Street, and
then in Queen Victoria Street.
</p>

<p>
The move was an effective one.  Three
minutes was just long enough to tangle
up the traffic, and start the police on their
counter-measures.  It was more than
twenty minutes in each case before they
discovered that the Klein-Pethwick Effect
had shifted on.  The result was that the
arrangements made for the diversion of
traffic made the confusion worse.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Harassed policemen, faced with a
whole succession of contradictory
orders as to which streets were clear and
which not, lost their heads completely in
the end.  Matters were at a worse pass
even than yesterday when the police had
no warning.  All round the City the jam
was complete.  It was that time that
Pethwick straightened his back, switched off
the power, and realized that he was hungry.
</p>

<p>
So far on every day that he had spent
in the City he had forgotten about his
lunch; in part it was a forgetfulness that
Freud could explain, because Pethwick
shrank a little from the prospect of
entering a strange restaurant and ordering food
from a menu in which he was sure to lose
his way.  But today he felt equal to the
effort, especially with the aid of his new
clothes.  He dismantled the apparatus and
locked it away, put on the beautiful grey
suit, and went out into the seething streets
in search of food.
</p>

<p>
At the table to which chance led him
there were five young men having lunch,
but it was not of course pure chance that
they were debating the Peacemaker's activities.
It would have been extraordinary
if Pethwick had found a table where the
diners were not doing so.  Pethwick
listened to their conversation while he ate
his fried fillets of plaice.  Pethwick was
just like a maiden aunt; maiden aunts
always choose fried fillets of plaice if it
ever happens that they must eat in a
strange restaurant.
</p>

<p>
The general attitude of the five young
men towards the Peacemaker was one of
admiration, perhaps even of envy.  They
did not blame him in the least for what
he had done.  They called it a "sporting
effort"; they thought it rather amusing
that he should set a city of ten million
souls in a turmoil.  They laughed
immoderately at the account of the fury of the
senior partner who employed one of them
at the non-arrival of something or other
which he was urgently expecting.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick listened to all this with a secret
pleasure.  It was only after some time that
he began to realize that none of this
admiration was directed towards the object
he had in mind when he began.  There was
no word among them about disarmament.
</p>

<p>
Twice Pethwick put down his knife and
fork and looked across at them.  He was
on the point of asking them what was
their opinion of disarmament and the
Peacemaker's views, but he found he
simply could not bring himself to plunge
uninvited into conversation with strangers;
besides, he feared lest he might betray
himself.  And then, right at the very end
of the meal, the thin dark one of the
party brought up the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he really means it about
this disarmament business?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"He's got a hope if he does, poor blighter,"
said the red-haired one.  "But I don't
expect he does.  Give us my ticket, please,
Lilly."
</p>

<p>
That was all—two sentences exchanged
while they were getting up from the table.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick did not know it, but the color
had gone from his face and he walked
stiffly and more upright than usual as he
paid for his lunch and walked out of the
restaurant.  His first action when he was
back in his office was to pull out his
fountain-pen and reach for paper.  He must
clear up any doubts on the subject of his
earnestness straight away.
</p>

<p>
Yet to write that letter was more than
he could do.  He was no man of the pen.
It was torment to him to try and write in
detail about matters on which he felt very
strongly.  That original letter of his to <i>The
Times</i> showed how unsuited he was for
this part of the business.  It told all the
necessary facts, but without embellishment
or elaboration.  And a man who wishes
to plead a cause before the masses must
learn not to flinch from reiteration, must
not spare his own feelings—if he has any—must
point the obvious and not hesitate in
the matter of clap-trap appeal.  He must
do all the things Pethwick shrank from doing.
</p>

<p>
What Pethwick needed at the moment
was someone to play Huxley to his Darwin,
someone of fluent pen and vigorous argument,
who could encase the mailed fist of
Pethwick's brute force in the velvet glove
of words.  The time was ripe for a brilliant
exposition of Pethwick's ideals.  A
well-written statement of the case for
disarmament might at the moment have been read
with sympathy, now that the wandering
attention of the public had been diverted
towards it for a space.  Pethwick had
actually felt this when he came back to the
office; just for a moment he had been in
touch with public opinion—a most unusual
state of affairs for Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
But with pen and paper before him the
momentary inspiration oozed away.  He
could not state the obvious all over again.
People who wanted to know what his proposal
was could refer to today's <i>Times</i>—Pethwick
did not appreciate the fact that
in a week's time no one would dream of
referring back to an issue a week old; he
judged people by himself, and he was quite
accustomed to being referred to arguments
printed in the <i>British Journal of Physics</i>
months ago.
</p>

<p>
And he had not the arts of demagogy.
Now that he had caught the attention of
the public he could not change his tactics
and revert from threats to argument—he
could not, that is to say, take a lesson from
the practice of public speakers who start
their speeches with an anecdote in order
to induce people to listen to them before
proceeding to argue.  He had not guessed
at the subtle mixture of force and persuasion
which is necessary to get things done.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
If Pethwick had ever made use of
analogy, he might have compared himself
with a parent who finds his child
playing with an adder under the impression
that it is a grass snake.  Probably the
parent has only to say "Put down that snake.
If it bites you you will die," to be obeyed.
At worst he has only to add, "If you don't
put it down I will smack you."  To
Pethwick the attitude of the world towards
armaments could not be very different
from that of the child towards the adder.
Circumstances had compelled him to start
with the smack to attract the child's
attention and to show him that smacking was
possible, but after the smack no intelligent
child would go on playing with the adder
when once he had been told it was poisonous.
Perhaps dealing with intelligent children
had unfitted Pethwick for dealing
with the public.
</p>

<p>
The result of the fading out of the
inspiration which had possessed him on his
return was that the letter he wrote was
excessively brief.
</p>

<p>
All he said was:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Dear Sir,</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I am quite sincere in my desire to bring
about disarmament.  I hope that the necessary
steps will soon be taken to initiate the
movement.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  <i>Yours truly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacemaker.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That was all he could say.  Once again,
it was a complete statement of the relevant
facts, and Pethwick could not imagine any
necessity for further elaboration—for a
few seconds he had had the revelation, but
it was gone now.
</p>

<p>
As he addressed the envelope, he remembered,
with an odd twisted smile, that
the police were after him now.  It was very
likely that a watch was being kept in
Printing House Square to see who might
be delivering letters by hand, Pethwick
decided that it would be better to send the
letter by post.  It would reach <i>The Times</i>
office by the evening, and ought even then
to appear in the morning's issue.
</p>

<p>
And when he had posted the letter he
realized that there was nothing more for
him to do today.  He might as well go home,
and he turned his steps towards London
Bridge and the station.  The sight of the
evening newspaper placards suddenly
reminded him that he had not read the early
edition he had bought—he must have lost
it somewhere or other.  He did something
he had never done before in his life—he
bought copies of all the three London
evening papers, and went on board the train
with them.
</p>

<p>
He was almost prepared, by now, for the
reception which the papers were according
to his proposals for augmenting the
well-being of the world.  There was a howl of
indignation in every column.  As he passed
from page to page he found the same
attitude maintained.  The Peacemaker's activities
were a criminal impertinence.  He must
be mad to imagine that a country like
England could be driven into a change of
policy by high-handed methods.
</p>

<p>
The sooner the police pulled themselves
together and laid this dangerous lunatic
by the heels the better.  It was not by
crimes against private property that the
world had ever been reformed.  Had the
Peacemaker taken no thought for the
unoffending people his actions would injure—the
clerks in the buses, the firms which
owned the lorries?  Had he forgotten the
injury he would be doing England?  He
was impeding England's sacred commerce,
stopping the flow of her very life-blood.
Not to any great extent, of course, so this
leader hastened to add.  But sufficiently,
perhaps, to damage England's credit in
foreign eyes, because foreign public
opinion was likely to take an exaggerated view
of disturbances occurring in peaceful England.
</p>

<p>
The second paper was as violent.  According
to this one, the Peacemaker's activities
were as bad as those of the bombing
aeroplanes which he professed to
deprecate.  A bomb dropped in a town did
indiscriminate damage to the private
property of unoffending citizens.  So did this
new invention.  The leader ventured to
cast doubts on the nationality of the
man—or men—who were guilty of this
un-national act.  It was not what could be
expected of Englishmen.  Far more likely
it was part of a Bolshevik plot, or it was
a Communist affair.  On another column
this paper had gone to the trouble to
collect legal opinions on the subject of with
what crimes the Peacemaker could be
charged when he was apprehended.  The
list was portentous, ranging from petty
offences like obstructing streets and
causing a crowd to collect all the way up to the
heights of high treason—one very eminent
legal luminary had committed himself to
this last.
</p>

<p>
Alongside this column was another,
made up of fresh interviews with scientists
regarding the nature of the new phenomenon
and the methods by which the miscreant
could be traced.
</p>

<p>
Most of these opinions were singularly
cautious.  The inevitable Norbury made a
great play with references to Clerk Maxwell's
calculations regarding the ratio between
the electro-magnetic and electro-static
constants of the ether, but he did
not seem to advance very far along those
lines.  On the contrary, the impression on
the reader's mind was that Norbury was
fighting a brilliant rearguard action,
carrying out his retirement behind a
skirmishing screen of technicalities.
</p>

<p>
One or two other people were a little
bolder: but the most noticeable unanimity
of opinion was that everyone agreed now
that the thing could be done, even though
no one could put forward a working
suggestion as to how.  No one—not even
Norbury, who had brought the matter to
Pethwick's notice—seemed to remember
anything about the researches of the late
August Klein.
</p>

<p>
Next to these columns came the cartoon,
which displayed the Peacemaker (a brilliant
conception distinguished by a squint,
round spectacles, straws in his hair, and a
wide grin that displayed vast teeth),
hitting John Citizen on the head with a club,
and saying: "There, that'll show you how
to be peaceful."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
The last thing Pethwick bothered to
read in this paper was the usual sort
of column filled with the usual sort of
sentiment about the blessings of peace and
disarmament.  Every paper, even the most
bellicose, had evinced (as Dorothy Laxton
had pointed out to Pethwick weeks ago)
occasional sentiments of this sort ever
since 1918.  They had every appearance of
being genuine; it was bewildering.
</p>

<p>
Apparently the writer of this particular
article had been in search of variety.
Whereas every other article had begun by
condemnation of the Peacemaker's methods
and had concluded with the perfunctory
paragraph of lip service to the cause
of peace, this writer had simply reversed
the process.  He enumerated the blessings
of peace, and had even quoted from the
long list of distinguished men who were
on the side of disarmament; but from
there he proceeded to attack the
Peacemaker's methods of attaining these ends.
Such was the vehemence of the attack, so
obviously had he no words bad enough to
do justice to his subject, and so skillfully
were his arguments mustered, that the
final effect left upon the mind of the
reader was that all this condemnation was
equally deserved by the names quoted
higher up.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick had not started the third
paper when the train ran into the station
and he got out.  Walking home, along the
High Street and up Verulam Road, he felt
depression overcoming him.  If this were
the way which his attempt to ameliorate
the condition of the world was going to be
received, he was up against a very difficult
task.  Yet it was not the difficulties ahead
of him which depressed him so much as
the incredible stupidity of mankind.
</p>

<p>
All the opposition to his scheme he
attributed to prejudice and inertia.  In a new
moment of clairvoyance he realized that
prejudices were far bigger obstacles than
convictions.  All this vast mass of prejudice
must be swept away before he could win
through to Dorothy's favor, and not only
here in England, but to France, Germany,
Poland, Italy.
</p>

<p>
It was a long, dreary, lonely road that
lay ahead of him.  But all the same,
there was something about Pethwick which
made him more determined the more he
realized the difficulties he had to
encounter.  His chin came forward and his
head came up.  By the time he reached
the corner of Launceton Avenue he looked
twice the man he had appeared when he
got down from the train.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was that gesture of straightening
his back which reminded him of
what he had not done, or perhaps it was
just the gleam of the beautiful suit which
caught his eye.  Pethwick stopped in
consternation.  Here he was, only a hundred
yards from home, still wearing his new
clothes.  If the realization had been
delayed two more minutes Mary would have
seen them.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick felt himself flush as he pictured
to himself the torrent of questions
to which he would have been instantly
subjected, the suspicion and the
embarrassment.  The cause for which he was
laboring, even, would have been
imperilled—Pethwick had no doubts about the
chances of his secret being disclosed if
Mary shared it.  There was only one thing
to do.  Pethwick turned about abruptly,
back to the station, by train back to
London Bridge, back to the office, where he
changed his clothes.
</p>

<p>
It was the clearest warning he had
received of the necessity of constant
vigilance and attention.  The slightest slip
would mean the end of all his fine plans;
though they were not so important,
imprisonment, unemployment, and starvation.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
<i>The Times</i> next day was outspoken
in its condemnation of the Peacemaker.
Pethwick at breakfast read
much the same sentiments as he had read
the day before in the evening papers, with
the addition of a violent editorial tirade
against the insolence of the new letter
the Peacemaker had had the impertinence
to address to them.  That anyone should
dream to dictate a policy to the British
Empire in a laconic note of three lines was
positively unbearable.  The Peacemaker
must learn that Britons were made of
sterner stuff.  They would never submit to
such high-handed methods.
</p>

<p>
It was worse still that the Peacemaker
should have backed his demand with a
further wanton interference with London
traffic.  He had caused a great deal of
inconvenience and perhaps some petty loss.
The mere fact that he had done this was
sufficient justification for ignoring his
letters altogether.  There could be no thought
of doing anything whatever to meet the
demands of someone actually engaged in
criminal practices.  Nevertheless, if
Pethwick had been able to read between the
lines he might have found some hope in
the irritation which <i>The Times</i> displayed
at the dilatory methods of the police.
</p>

<p>
These latter, so <i>The Times</i> declared,
ought to have laid the Peacemaker by the
heels hours ago.  It was a poor testimony
to their modern scientific methods that
they had not succeeded in tracing him at
once.  Surely with the whole body of
public opinion behind them, and the advice
of the whole scientific world to draw upon
should they need it, they should do better
than this.  But at any rate, <i>The Times</i>
understood that the police were engaged in
following up various clues which they had
discovered.  Perhaps at the very time these
lines were read an arrest may have been
effected, and in a few weeks' time this mad
effort by the Peacemaker would be falling
back into the oblivion which characterised
similar hopeless attempts at revolution by
violence, like the Cato Street conspiracy.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick read this pious wish with a
little smile.  He could not imagine anyone
discovering him—in that he was like many
other criminals.  No one would ever
commit a crime if he was not confident that
he would avoid detection.
</p>

<p>
And, as a matter of fact Pethwick was
safe enough.  The police had not the least
idea how to set about discovering him.
</p>

<p>
No scientist could suggest how the Klein-Pethwick
Effect was caused.  No examination
of lists of prominent Communists or
Pacifists could offer any line of investigation
to follow.  The task of the police could
be compared with looking for a needle in
a bundle of hay if one was not quite sure
what a needle was like and had doubts as
to where the bundle of hay actually was.
The police would have to wait in patience
for the help of their usual allies—carelessness
on the part of the man they were
seeking, and "information received," and
blind good fortune.
</p>

<p>
The one possible loophole centered round
Mr. Todd, who had let the Hammer Court
office to Dr. Pethwick.  It was just possible
that he might connect Dr. Pethwick with
these outrages—but the possibility seemed
much smaller on closer examination than
at first sight.  For Mr. Todd let offices every
day of his life; his encounter with
Dr. Pethwick made far more impression on
Dr. Pethwick than on Mr. Todd.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the Hammer Court office
was underground and tucked away in a
cul-de-sac.  It was quite distant from, and
completely out of sight of, the scenes of
the Peacemaker outrages.  The unscientific
mind, even in these days of wireless
telephony, found it hard to conceive of a
power which could make itself felt through
solid earth and stone walls, and without
any great preparation and in a room no
larger than the average kitchen.  Mr. Todd
can certainly be excused for not connecting
the polished, well-dressed, completely
sensible gentleman with the fanatical
figure portrayed in Poy's cartoons.
</p>

<p>
It was a pity that Pethwick had had the
wit to realize all this at the same time as
he had the folly to think that humanity
could be coerced into doing something for
its own good.  Pethwick, of course, had
fallen into the old error of confounding
persons with people, individuals with the
mass.  He did not appreciate that where a
hundred separate individuals might each
be relied on to be perfectly sensible when
conducting their particular concerns, that
same hundred people considered as a mass
might be guilty of the most illogical actions.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Times</i> was in the process of disillusioning
him.  What irritated him most was
the fact that the objective he desired
most—the establishment of an international
conference determined upon disarmament,
and not held back by secret instructions or
sheer stupidity—was not discussed at all.
The possibility was quite ignored.  Apart
from the usual vague tributes to the
blessings of peace the whole attention of the
paper was concentrated upon abusing him
and his methods, in a way Pethwick had
not expected at all.
</p>

<p>
In his vague visualization of the result
of his efforts Pethwick had thought that
the attention of the public would be
directed upon disarmament, with only the
slightest notice taken of himself once the
initial surprise had worn off.  He was both
embarrassed by and annoyed at the
publicity he was receiving.  And to see it
broadly hinted that his sole object was
personal publicity, and to see himself
compared with a maniac who drops a bomb
from the gallery into the crowded stalls of
a theatre, simply maddened him.  He flung
the paper aside testily, caught his wife's
eye, and applied himself guiltily to his
breakfast.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
When breakfast was over he was
vaguely restless.  He had decided that
there was no need to go up to the office
that morning, and the unusual prospect of
an idle day before him seemed extraordinarily
irksome.  He idled about the room;
he helped his wife wash up.  And then
when Mary had gone out shopping and he
found himself alone in the house restlessness
overcame him.  He felt absolutely no
temptation to sit down with a book, as he
would have loved to do six months ago.
Ten minutes after Mary had gone out
Pethwick went out too, having spent the
ten minutes walking aimlessly from room
to room about the house.
</p>

<p>
At the station bookstall he asked for all
the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the bookstall attendant
unmoved—it is a request which is made to
bookstall attendants more often than one
would expect.  "Financial papers as well?"
</p>

<p>
"M'm, well—no," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"And you don't want <i>The Times</i>, do you,
sir?  We delivered that to you this morning.
But there's the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have that," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
With London's eight other newspapers
and the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> under his
arm he went back to Launceton Road, and
for the first time in his life he set himself
to a study of public opinion.
</p>

<p>
Public opinion in this case seemed to be
practically unanimous.  Wherever
Pethwick turned his eyes, it seemed to him,
they encountered cries of rage, frozen into
print, like Niagara in winter.  These
newspapers were all a day behind <i>The Times</i>,
for once in a way, because they had no
knowledge of the Peacemaker's third
letter, but they made up for it in the violence
of their opinions.
</p>

<p>
The expression "private property"
cropped up over and over again; the fact
that the Peacemaker was interfering with
private property appeared to be the
measure of his crime—one was left with the
impression that if the Peacemaker had
confined his activities to government
concerns he would not have been so
guilty—although, as Pethwick assured himself
when this occurred to him, there would
have been just as much fury evinced if he
had held up the Fleet, or tank evolutions
on Salisbury Plain.  They would have
attacked him on the other flank then, for
lack of patriotism or something.
</p>

<p>
As it was one newspaper roundly accused
him of being unpatriotic (in a special
sense, that is—all the articles
condemned him vaguely under that head).
This particular article was one of the few
which condescended to discuss the one
thing the Peacemaker had asked for—an
international conference.  The Peacemaker
must be unpatriotic, argued this article,
for if such a conference were to be held—as
of course was inconceivable—England
would come to it gravely handicapped
from the start.  As a result of the other
powers at the conference knowing that she
was being forced into it, her bargaining
power would be terribly limited, so that
she would be bound to be worst off.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick scratched his head at that.  He
could not imagine what bargaining had to
do with the sort of conference he had in
mind—which just shows what a simple
fellow he was.  He knew perfectly well that
a disarmament conference with no <i>arrière-pensée</i>
at all would settle the whole matter
in a week's discussion, or in three hours,
for that matter, if intelligent men were
sent there—but even Dr. Pethwick was not
so simple as to expect this last.  But this
"bargaining" suggestion left him puzzled.
It was the complete negation of the notion
he himself harboured.  He tossed the paper
aside and turned to the others.
</p>

<p>
The little illustrated papers were just as
bad.  They were full of pictures showing
the traffic jams in Cannon Street and
Cheapside.  They published, at the request
of the police, the same photographic
reproductions of the Peacemaker's manifesto
(they all called it that) as <i>The Times</i>
had published the day before.  But they
gave no hint at all of extending a welcome
to a movement which might reduce income
tax by half-a-crown in the pound, which
was remarkable when considered in
conjunction with their repeated references to
"private property."
</p>

<p>
Some of the other papers simply foamed
at the mouth.  <i>The Times</i> had been
studiously moderate in estimating the amount
of trouble caused by the Peacemaker's
activities—partly from a simple desire to
allay possible public agitation, and partly,
it is to be imagined, to show—the
peacemaker that he was not as important an
individual as he thought he was.  But
newspapers who never included the word
"moderation" in their vocabularies
let themselves go—especially as this was
August, when every newspaper prays for
something to happen, and when newspapers
which deal with sensations begin to
pine and die.
</p>

<p>
They wrote up the traffic scenes and the
disorder in the City with vast headlines
and heavy cross-headings.  It was curious
that at the same time they declared, in
other columns, that the total effect
produced was infinitesimal compared with the
whole bulk of London traffic.  Pethwick
was vaguely reminded of the days during
the war when he was a boy, when with one
breath the newspapers described the
difficulties experienced in an offensive, and
with the next boldly declared that the
enemy was not merely drained of his
strength but thoroughly demoralized into
the bargain.
</p>

<p>
Even the more moderate newspapers
were not encouraging.  They deplored the
rash action of the Peacemaker, nor would
they offer the most cautious approval of
his motives.  Indeed, they made haste to
declare their conviction that the
Peacemaker could not possibly be a member of
the political parties which they supported.
They were most anxious to show that
although they had always been steady
advocates of disarmament they abhorred
this kind of militant peacemaking.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick dropped the last of the papers
beside him and fell into thought.
He was sick with disappointment.  At first
it was not his failure that moved him so
much as the fact that humanity was
exhibiting itself in so deplorable a light.
Only later did he begin to think about
himself.  When Dorothy came back from
Norway he would only have this fiasco to
show her.  He would not be haloed with
glory and success.  True, he had made a
noise in the world, but Pethwick judged
that a failure, however noisy, would not
re-establish himself in Dorothy's good
opinion.  Lordly Ones never fail.
</p>

<p>
His feelings were wounded, too, by the
venomous remarks of the newspapers.  It
hurt him to be compared with bomb-throwing
notoriety-hunters, to have it said
of him that he was traitorous and un-English;
to have the purity of his motives
impugned; to see it hinted broadly that
he must be insane.
</p>

<p>
It was under the stress of all these
mixed motives that his expression hardened
and his mouth shut tightly.  Let them
say what they liked, think what they
liked.  He was going through with it.  He
would show them what they were up
against.  He would compel them to take
the matter seriously.  If they would not
act of their own accord after this reminder
of what was to their advantage, he would
force them to do so.  He would intensify
his campaign.  Already in his mind he had
vague ideas, as to further uses to which his
invention could be put.  He began to fill in
the details, to make plans.
</p>

<p>
So engrossed was he that he did not hear
Mary's return.  She found him sitting in
the armchair with newspapers littered all
about him, and she was about to upbraid
him when she saw his face.  The sound of
her voice died away in her throat and she
stood with her mouth wide open in surprise.
She had never seen him like this
before; his mouth was shut in a hard line,
his brows were drawn together; his whole
expression was one of ferocious determination.
</p>

<p>
Even his hands were clenched tight.
Anything more different from his usual
expression of mild abstraction it was
difficult to imagine.  She was frightened; there
was something satanic in the contrast
between his pleasant features and the brutal
determination they expressed.  To Mary's
distorted imagination, that was how
Pethwick would look if Pethwick were ever to
commit a murder.  And Mary realized that
there was only one person on earth whom
he was likely ever to want to murder—herself.
She had a spasm of fright lest by
some evil chance Pethwick had discovered
that she had been telling lies to Dorothy
Laxton.  She felt a chilly sensation run
down her body and legs.
</p>

<p>
But that fear was quickly dispelled by
Pethwick's sudden awakening to her
presence.  He started guiltily.  The strange
look faded from his face and was replaced
by one which might be seen on the face
of a child discovered in naughtiness.  He
was momentarily afraid lest Mary should
start making deductions from his attitude,
from the newspapers strewn around him.
</p>

<p>
But Pethwick had known his wife too
long in ordinary circumstances to be able
to predict her conduct with any certainty
in extraordinary ones.  He was familiar
with her illogical habits of thought, with
the way in which the processes of her
mind were habitually tangled up.  He gave
her no credit for flashes of intuition, nor
for the very real capacity for putting two
and two together which she could display
in an emergency.  Illogical logic was so
foreign both to his make-up and to his
training that he had only contempt for it,
a tendency to underrate its possibilities.
He did not realize how easy it is for a
woman, even one as muddled as Mary, to
guess at the state of mind of a man with
whom she has lived for ten years.
</p>

<p>
Mary's first words seemed to dispel any
doubts he had regarding whether she had
noticed anything strange.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth is all this mess?" asked
Mary.  She could begin no domestic
conversation without a complaint.
</p>

<p>
"It's only today's newspapers," said
Pethwick, soothingly.  "I'll clear them up now."
</p>

<p>
"So I should think.  You clear them all up
and take them away.  I won't have them
cluttering up <i>my</i> house.  I can't think
what you wanted them all for."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick had what he considered a
brilliant inspiration.
</p>

<p>
"I only wanted to see what they said
about this Peacemaker business," he said,
with elaborate carelessness.  "It raises a
very interesting problem in physics.  It
would be an interesting problem to work
out what is this method he uses."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
She watched his gawky movements as
he tried to put the papers together.  Her
eyes were bright and unwinking.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick's instincts were goading
him into action.  Perhaps he actually
felt that this was the time for words more
than deeds, but he was not a man of
words.  He could not write the long letter
to <i>The Times</i>, which might have been his
best move now.  He could not write the
pleading disclaimer of all the incorrect
motives which had been attributed to him,
nor, now that he could be sure of the
attention of his audience, could he write
the long academic defense of disarmament,
humorous, persuasive, convincing,
which might save the situation.  In his
present state of irritation all that was
beyond him.  He would go on as he had
begun.  As a hint had not been enough, he
must proceed to give indisputable evidence
of his power and his determination.  Plans
and calculations seethed in his mind.
</p>

<p>
One stray by-product of a scientific
training is an ability to use reference
books, to dig out the most obscure data
from the most unpromising authorities.
Dr. Pethwick after lunch went round to
the public library to find out things about
Paris.  His knowledge of the French
language was limited to two dozen words; he
had never crossed the Channel.  But that
accusation of being unpatriotic had hurt
him, and moreover he was beginning to
realize the necessity of convincing other
nations besides the English of the
desirability of disarmament.  Some time soon
he must extend his activities to the
Continent, and before he could really begin
planning this new offensive he must have
facts to work upon.
</p>

<p>
In the reference library the Librarian
welcomed him.  Dr. Pethwick had a certain
reputation for vast learning which
extended through the suburb from its focus
in the school.  There was a good deal of
deference in the Librarian's manner.  He
found Dr. Pethwick an isolated table with
pens and ink and blotting-paper, and
made him free of all shelves of standard
reference books which Dr. Pethwick said
he wished to consult.  Then he withdrew
on tiptoe, awed and reverent, while
Dr. Pethwick plunged eagerly into this new
investigation.
</p>

<p>
That knack of his to find his way about
books of reference was very evident here.
He made one or two false starts—for
instance, he found <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i> for
once in a way singularly unhelpful—but
in two hours he had accumulated all the
facts he needed, by the aid of three
gazetteers, a handbook on <i>What to See in Paris</i>,
the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, and a
Dictionary of French Technical Terms.
</p>

<p>
The plans for a raid on Paris were taking
shape rapidly in his mind.  The two or
three important pieces of apparatus which
he would need he could take in his pockets
to avoid questions at the customs examination
which he expected.  With the aid
of the technical dictionary he would be
able to buy the more ordinary pieces—they
were things which anyone might
want and could buy without exciting
suspicion in a radio shop.  He had looked up
the items in the dictionary to make sure.
</p>

<p>
For the rest—he knew now what was the
voltage and cycles per second of the Paris
electricity supply.  He knew that the
generating station was at Colombes, on the
Seine bank opposite Argenteuil, a couple
of miles from the center of Paris.  He had
studied the maps of Paris, and he had
decided that the thickest traffic ought to
be somewhere along the Rue de Rivoli.  In
his mind he had picked out the intersection
of the Rue de Pont Neuf, but that
could wait until he was able to study the
situation with his own eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was all very straightforward.  He could
find his way to Paris, he supposed—he
would have to encounter French customs
officers and French railway porters and
find a train in a French station, but if the
worst came to the worst he could follow
some English people who appeared to be
sure of what they were doing.  Then—a
room in an hotel, a rapid purchase of the
materials he would need, a couple of days
spent on the construction of the new
condenser and emitter, and he could attack
the Paris traffic from his hotel room.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick put all the books back
tidily on the shelves and walked out,
smiling his thanks to the Librarian.  He would
carry out the scheme shortly; before he
could set about it he intended to make a
further attempt to stir London out of its
sluggishness—and, more important still,
he had to decide how to persuade Mary
to agree to his leaving her for a few days.
That was going to be difficult; they had
not been separated for as much as a night
for ten years.  He would have to think out
how best to set about it while he was
proceeding with his next move.
</p>

<p>
He walked down the steps of the library
into the High Street again.  His eye was
caught by the posters of a man selling
evening newspapers—"Peacemaker's New
Impertinence."  Presumably that was a
comment on his brief letter to <i>The Times</i>
which had appeared that morning.  He did
not buy a paper—he had read enough
newspaper criticism for one day, and he
was already experienced enough to guess
at the tone of this new effusion.  His
mouth set hard again at the thought of
it.  Quite unconsciously he quickened his
steps so as to hasten his entry upon his
new move.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Lenham's garage was some way down
the High Street from the station.
Dr. Pethwick walked in up the crescent-shaped
cement path beside the petrol
pumps, and stood for a moment hesitating
at the open doors of the big workshop,
where innumerable motor-cars in all
stages of dissection—one or two of them,
perhaps, were there as the result of his
efforts of the previous days—were being
dealt with by mechanics.  Then Pethwick
smiled as a lean young man in blue
overalls came hastening up to him.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Lenham," said Dr. Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Doctor.  It's very nice
to see you here."
</p>

<p>
Young Lenham—son and heir of old
Lenham who owned the garage—had been
a favorite pupil of Dr. Pethwick's five
years ago.  He still cherished an affection
for the kindly man who had initiated him
into the mysteries of electricity and
magnetism and statics.  His white teeth showed
up in his swarthy sunburned face as he
grinned hospitably at the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen you once or twice at the station,
lately, sir," said Lenham, "but you
always seemed to be in a bit of a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've been busy for the last day or
two," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
There was a little pause in which they
went on smiling at each other.  Pethwick's
heart was warmed by this discovery that
there was one person at least in the
world who seemed pleased to see him.
Then he realized that he ought to state
his business; it was a little bit of an effort
to take the plunge.
</p>

<p>
"What I want to talk to you about," he
said, at length, "is that I want a motor-car."
</p>

<p>
"A car?" said Lenham.
</p>

<p>
Automatically Lenham's face assumed
the expression common to all dealers in
motor-cars when possible purchases are
under discussion—the same alert
impassivity as can be seen on the face of an
Irish horse-dealer; but he grinned again
immediately.  He did not want to make
money out of the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"A new one?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Dr. Pethwick.  "It will have
to be an old one.  I haven't very much
money."
</p>

<p>
"None of us have," Lenham grinned.
"But I expect I can find something for
you.  What sort of a car do you want?
Two-seater?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Pethwick.  "I want an enclosed
car.  I think it's called a saloon."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Lenham.  He was quick to
realize that there actually existed on earth
people who were doubtful about the
differences between saloons and coupés and
and touring-cars.
</p>

<p>
"How much were you thinking of spending?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not very much," said Pethwick, who
had only the vaguest notion as to how
much a second-hand saloon motor-car
might cost.  All he knew was that
occasionally in common-room conversations he
had heard stray allusions to the
cheapness of second-hand cars.
</p>

<p>
"Well," explained Lenham, patiently.
"It's this way.  You can get a second-hand
car for ten pounds.  But you can pay two
hundred if you want to."
</p>

<p>
"Ten pounds sounds very much like the
figure I want to pay," said Pethwick.  "I
don't want anything very elaborate.  I
just want—I just want—"
</p>

<p>
"Something which goes and keeps the
rain out?" said Lenham.
</p>

<p>
"That's right."
</p>

<p>
Lenham led Dr. Pethwick round behind
the workshop to a row of lock-up garages.
He undid a padlock, swung open the doors
and with a gesture invited Dr. Pethwick's
consideration of the contents.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Dr. Pethwick, vaguely, peering
inside.  "Yes.  It looks very nice."
</p>

<p>
"There's your cheap car, sir," said Lenham,
walking in.  "1925 Morris.  It'll run
as long as ever you want—it's got the old
Vickers engine, you know."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Pethwick eyed the vehicle.  Up to
this time one motor-car had been very
like another motor-car to Dr. Pethwick.
That bull-nosed bonnet, that box-like
body, meant nothing to him.  He did not
realize that in the eyes of the <i>illuminati</i>
they indicated that the car was eight years
old and therefore as much out of date as
a sedan chair or an ancient British
chariot.  He literally meant what he said
when he said that all he wanted was a
car which would go along and keep the
rain out.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to try her?" asked Lenham.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick.  "I should.  But
I can't drive a car."
</p>

<p>
Lenham tried to look as if every day of
the week he met people who could not
drive a car.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact, Lenham," went on
Dr. Pethwick, "I was going to ask you if
you would teach me."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to, sir," said Lenham, and
he meant it.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
In the office Dr. Pethwick signed a
check for fifteen pounds for the car,
and a check for ten pounds in payment of
tax to the end of the year and insurance.
</p>

<p>
"Now you go to County Hall tomorrow
and get your license," said Lenham, "and
we'll take her out tomorrow afternoon.  I
suppose you'll be wanting to drive by
Bank Holiday."
</p>

<p>
Bank Holiday was next Monday—four
days off.  Pethwick nodded.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," he said, awkwardly,
"would you mind not saying anything
about this?  My wife—"
</p>

<p>
The sentence trailed off into nothingness,
but Lenham nodded paternally—this
interview had made him feel really
paternal towards this rather pathetic
figure.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," he said.  "You want it
to be a surprise."
</p>

<p>
Lenham had sold motor-cars to certainly
not less than a hundred excited husbands
who wanted to give their wives a
surprise.  That fact saved Pethwick from
telling the only lie he had been able to
think of, to the effect that his wife did
not approve of motor-cars.
</p>

<p>
So that the Friday before Bank Holiday
Pethwick had a busy day.  First he had
to go to Hammer Court, and set up his
apparatus, and set the Klein-Pethwick
Effect at work upon the main traffic
crossing in front of the Royal Exchange; as
he was not intending to remain in the
office to shift the emitter about he selected
the most vulnerable part of the City for
his demonstration.  Then, leaving the
apparatus at work, and at the very moment
when London fell into the turmoil which
was beginning to be almost its usual
condition, he locked his office door and
hurried off to Westminister Bridge to obtain
his driving license.
</p>

<p>
With that in his possession he came back
to the City—casually thinking the while
of the oddity of a world which hands over
with less than half an hour's formality a
permit to anyone to make use of a machine
which could be quite as dangerous to
innocent people as a high-explosive bomb—and
he won his way with difficulty back
to Hammer Court.  Queen Victoria Street
and Cannon Street were crammed as ever
with congested traffic; the usual
policemen were diverting everything from the
heart of the City.  Near the Mansion
House Pethwick saw the emergency horses
coming up to help—already the policemen
had made permanent arrangements for
teams to pull helpless vehicles out of the way.
</p>

<p>
Locked again in his office, Pethwick
spent one half hour on making the task
of the police more difficult by turning the
emitter steadily around on its center,
catching Cannon Street at its very worst
and positively raising Cain by holding
paralyzed everything at the corner of
Cheapside and King Street.  Here, a busy
police inspector, emboldened by the
apparent permanence of the stay of the
Klein-Pethwick Effect outside the Royal
Exchange, had been sending traffic by the
comparatively short detour through
Gresham Street and Throgmorton Street.
</p>

<p>
The mischief completed, Pethwick dismantled
his apparatus again, locked his
cupboard and his office door, and started
back for home.  There was a most unusual
and very pleasant bubble of excitement
in his breast as he walked back over London
Bridge.  Even Dr. Pethwick, a dry-as-dust
Professor, and one furthermore with
all his serious purposes in view, could
feel a little thrill of exhilaration at the
thought that he was actually going to
drive a motor car today.
</p>

<p>
New interests had been rare in Dr. Pethwick's
life.  He had hardly ever had a
chance to be an ordinary human being—and
on the last occasion Dorothy had been
torn from him.  There was something
amazingly cheerful about the prospect of
learning to drive; it might be due in
part—the possibility is one which at least
merits consideration—to the fact that it
involved the needed companionship of
Lenham.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick had been fond of Lenham
when he had been his pupil, and he
liked him even better now.  Human society
had been denied Pethwick for a long time,
and recent events had both increased and
made him more conscious of his feeling
of isolation.  The man was so savagely
condemned by the whole Press of England
was immeasurably pleased at young
Lenham's evident pleasure in seeing him.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
After his midday dinner Pethwick
started out for Lenham's garage.  He
did not notice Mary's keen glance at him
when he announced his intention of being
out all the afternoon.  A factor which he
had not allowed for in his plans was
developing which might wreck them, and
he was still unaware of it.  Pethwick was
used to dealing with apparatus and with
mathematical expressions—reliable
instruments, whose behaviour in given
circumstances was at least calculable.  But
his own reactions, and those of his wife,
were not calculable.  He had never thought
that at the prospect of driving a motor-car
he would rise from the table exhibiting
pleasurable anticipation; nor had he
expected that his wife would be observant
enough to take notice of it.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick found Lenham standing beside
the open bonnet of the Morris.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we begin at the beginning, sir?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Er—yes, I suppose we had better," said
Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
It says much for the fantastic nature
of Pethwick's upbringing that, although a
Doctor of Science, he had never once
looked inside the bonnet of a motor-car.
But at least Pethwick's enormous theoretical
knowledge enabled him to follow
with ease Lenham's brief lecture upon
the mechanics of the internal-combustion
vehicle.  The clutch and the gearbox,
ignition and the variation in the timing
there-of, were all things with which Pethwick
was quite familiar in diagrams and to
some extent in bench demonstrations.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's everything," said Lenham,
pulling the jack away.  He had just jacked
up and changed a wheel, to the accompaniment
of Pethwick's unbounded admiration
for this technique, in a minute and
a quarter, as final part of his instruction
in running repairs.  "Let's take her out now.
We'll go round to the quiet streets—Dalkeith
Road is the best.  Will you drive her
there?"
</p>

<p>
Pethwick thought of the roaring High
Street traffic, of coloured lights and constables.
</p>

<p>
"I think it would be better if you did,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Yet all the same Pethwick proved himself
a not very slow pupil.  He knew before
he set out to drive what it was he had to
learn.  He knew of the necessity for
adjusting engine speed to road speed, so
that double declutching came easily to
him.  He fully appreciated the need for
letting in the clutch gently, and for
keeping the engine going, come what might.
</p>

<p>
The manipulative skill acquired at the
experimental bench came to his rescue,
too.  By the third attempt he was feeling
the gear lever into position like a good
driver, and the most complex problem of
driving was simpler than some of the
operations he had to perform in the
physics laboratory.  He did not get flurried
when he had to sound his horn, put out his
hand, turn his wheel, apply his brakes,
and change gear practically simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
"There ought to be something to do
with your teeth as well," said Lenham,
making the little stock joke he always
employed at this stage of the tuition.  But
Pethwick was keeping such a clear head
that on this occasion the point of the
joke was not quite so obvious.
</p>

<p>
As one would expect, Pethwick's main
trouble arose from lack of self-confidence.
He had to screw up his nerve to plunge
into traffic when the time came; he took
his foot hastily off the accelerator at the
very first sign of trouble ahead.  When
he had to make a right-hand turn out of
a busy street he found it hard to believe
that these lordly drivers would pay
attention to his out-stretched hand and let him
through—and as a matter of fact the
far-too-common drivers with bad road
manners did their best to discourage him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about the people behind,"
insisted Lenham.  "Put your hand out in
plenty of time, and then round you go.
It's only the damn' fools you have to look
out for."
</p>

<p>
All very well, but Pethwick had been
treated all his life with such scant courtesy
that he found difficulty in expecting
consideration.  Nor, with his ignorance of
humanity did he make allowance for the
fact that other drivers, seeing all the
danger signals of his indecision, would avoid
him like the plague.  And he was inexperienced
in making lightning estimates of
speed and distances; he found it difficult
to judge whether he had time in hand to
turn across an oncoming vehicle, or
whether a gap which presented itself
before him would remain open long enough
for him to avail himself of it.  So that
during the second hour he began to feel
nervous exhaustion overcoming him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind if we have a rest?" he
asked, when they turned once more into
a quiet side street.
</p>

<p>
Lenham was all contrition at once.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," he said.  "Let's stop
here for a bit.  You were getting on so
well that I was forgetting this was only
your first time out."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick pulled up carefully at the kerb,
and they sat side by side in the car, while
Pethwick revelled in the relief from strain
and glowed warmly with this last encomium
from Lenham.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen anything of this Peacemaker
business in the City?" asked Lenham.
</p>

<p>
It was an inevitable question, one which
everyone interested in motor-cars was
bound to ask in an idle moment.  Pethwick
took a grip on himself before he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, slowly.  "Two or three
times, as it happens."
</p>

<p>
"I've never been in town when it was
going on," said Lenham.  "But by all
accounts it seems to have done the trick all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"It must have held everything up
properly," went on Lenham.  "And we've got
two cars in the garage this minute that
we're having to put new magnetos into.
Lucky their owners were both insured
all-in."
</p>

<p>
"Can you insure against <i>that</i>?" asked
Pethwick, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Lenham.  "It was a bit of a
job getting the companies to see reason,
but we got them in the end under the
'civil commotion' clause.  So that's all
right.  But the owners are pretty furious,
all the same."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick said nothing in reply; there
seemed to be nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how to feel about it, sir,"
went on Lenham at length, "but I don't
think the Peacemaker's going to get very
far on these lines.  He's annoying people
too much—putting their backs up and yet
not causing quite enough trouble to be
taken seriously."
</p>

<p>
Again Pethwick did not answer.  He was
wondering whether the new scheme he
had in mind would cause enough trouble
for him to be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
"And yet I don't blame him, somehow,"
said Lenham, thoughtfully.  "It's a fine
ideal he's got before him.  Armaments are
a sheer waste of money and a very likely
cause of trouble.  People say that war's
inevitable, and a natural state of man, and
so on.  Well, even if it's true, the country
that can construct the most efficient
army in peace time would also be the one
which would win the war if one started
when everybody was disarmed.  It's—it's—I
mean it's just like a race.  Without
armaments it would be like everyone starting
from scratch.  Armaments are like giving
everyone a start, but the longest start to
the fastest runners instead of the slower
ones.  Abolition wouldn't make any
difference to anyone's prestige.  Powerful
countries would be just as safe, and weak
ones just about as unsafe.  I can't think
what all the fuss is about."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I think," said Pethwick,
carefully.
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity," said Lenham, "that the
Peacemaker can't work out another
invention.  There's only one thing I can
think of which would stop war for certain."
</p>

<p>
"And what is that?" asked Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"Something that would kill commanders-in-chief,"
said Lenham.  "If there
was a weapon which would do that for
certain, just one a day, let's say, I don't
think armies would exist very long."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick, and hesitated.  "So
you don't think the Peacemaker is going
to succeed?"
</p>

<p>
Lenham shook his head a little sadly.
</p>

<p>
"He <i>might</i>," he said, "if he's terrifically
lucky, and very persistent, and very rich,
so that he can extend his radius of action.
I hope he does.  But I can't believe he
will—perhaps that's just because what he's
after seems too good to be practicable.
After all, in the old days people laughed
at Jenner because they couldn't imagine
a world without smallpox.  Nowadays they
can't picture a world without armaments,
or unemployment, or hunger.  But there's
nothing intrinsically impossible about
these ideas.  He might bring them off."
</p>

<p>
They sat together in silence after that,
until Lenham stirred a little restlessly.  He
was feeling uncomfortable at his recent
self-revelation.
</p>

<p>
"Let's get going again," he said.  "I want
to see you go up the gears again."
</p>

<p>
And Pethwick's experimental training
revealed its depth once more.  Despite his
abstraction, despite the warm friendly
glow he felt towards Lenham, he did not
make the mistake Lenham was anticipating.
He took the car out of gear before
he stretched out his foot to the
self-starter button.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
On the Saturday before Bank
Holiday <i>The Times</i> appeared with the
contents bill and headlines—headlines
that Pethwick—this much at least
he had learned about the potentialities
of the British Press—had almost expected.
"New Manifesto from the Peacemaker," it
said.  "Fresh Threats."
</p>

<p>
The letter was brief, in the usual style
of the Peacemaker.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Dear Sir</i> (it said),
</p>

<p>
<i>I am sorry that so little attention has
been paid to my request for serious
consideration of the question of disarmament.
In consequence I propose to interfere
again with the traffic of the City
of London on Friday morning, as apparently
it is necessary, that I should have
to demonstrate once more the great
capacity for causing a disturbance which is
at my disposal.  In addition, I promise
that if nothing is done soon I shall have
to take further steps.  They will be of the
very greatest consequence, and will cause
inconvenience much greater than any that
has been caused up to the present.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick read the letter studiously.
There was no thrill at seeing his writings
printed in <i>The Times</i>.  And he was
conscious, vaguely, that the letter was not
all it should be.  But for the life of him
he could not see in what it was lacking.
It said everything that had to be said;
there was no possible double meaning
which could be read into it.  Two or three
of the phrases were modelled—unconsciously,
it is true—on some of the more
effective expressions employed by very
successful masters at the Liverpool School
when dealing with unruly classes.  Yet
there was no denying the fact that it
caused the public to be extremely annoyed—he
had only to glance at the editorial
comment to see that.  And the leader
referred to an interview which had been
granted by a Cabinet-minister—as it was
August, and the House was not sitting, the
usual method of obtaining an official
pronouncement by the aid of questions in the
Commons was unavailable.  Pethwick
searched for the interview and found it.
It was brief enough—almost as laconic as
the Peacemaker's writings themselves.
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty's Government," said the
minister, in reply to the questions put to
him, "is not accustomed to committing
itself to any policy at the dictation of
obscure agitators who have not the courage
to come out in the open.  England has, of
course, always been in favor of reduction
of armaments, and is accustomed to urge
this policy at every opportunity.  But the
government will not be deflected in the
least from its course either by threats or
by criminal activities."
</p>

<p>
Another article, after a description of
Friday's muddle in the City, compared the
Peacemaker's activities with those of the
advocates of women's suffrage before the
war, when windows were smashed and
country houses burned and letter boxes
filled with paint.  These crimes had not
brought the grant of women's suffrage
an inch nearer.  Pethwick scratched his
head, and raked back in his memory for
what he had learnt and the trifle he
could remember about the suffrage movement.
</p>

<p>
Women had the vote now, hadn't they?
There had been some excitement only a
little while ago about the extension of the
grant to women of twenty-one.  So the
movement must have succeeded at some
time or other, and not very long after all
these outrages catalogued here.  In
Pethwick's opinion it was an example of the
effectiveness of outrages, not of the
reverse.  The inconsistency would never
have been remedied if attention had not
been called to it by violent action.  So
would it be with armaments.  He was
going through with it, and <i>The Times</i> could
say what it liked.
</p>

<p>
He did not notice, when he rose from
the table to continue the execution of his
plan of campaign, how meekly Mary
acquiesced in his statement that he was
going out again that morning—but then he
could not know that as soon as he was
gone Mary pounced upon <i>The Times</i> and
studied carefully what he had been
reading.  From her seat opposite him she had
noted the position of those parts of the
newspaper which had most interested him.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick walked round to Lenham's
garage.  There was quite a pleasant thrill
about going up the alley at the back, and
taking out his key, and opening the door
to disclose his own motor-car.  There was
excitement in the prospect of driving the
car all by himself, without the solid moral
support of Lenham's presence, through
what he knew would be thick traffic.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
The difficulties he encountered
were largely those which he had not
anticipated.  He made the discovery that
it is by no means as easy as it appears
to back a motor-car out of a narrow
garage into a narrow alley.  Pethwick had
to climb out of the driver's seat eleven
times in all, to study the relative position
of wings and doorposts and walls, and to
note how the front wheels were set.
</p>

<p>
He got himself into such a muddle that
he had to go back and forward an inch
or two at a time, nearly a score of times,
before he could induce the nearside rear
wing to come round clear of the wall at
the same time as the nearside front wing
cleared the doorpost.  Even when the tip
of the bumper bar scored the paint.  In
this particular problem his theoretical
knowledge of mechanics and geometry always
asserted itself just a little too late
in dealing with the obstinate habit of the
front end of a motor-car moving in reverse
to take a larger circle than the rear end.
</p>

<p>
But he got it out at last.  He was quite
breathless by the time he shut the garage
door and climbed up into the driver's
seat for the last time.  He drove carefully
in bottom gear down the alley-way, and
after an unconscionable wait, he managed
to insert the Morris into the rush of
traffic in the High Street.  At a sober eighteen
miles an hour he began his voyage round
the suburbs.  Bus-drivers cursed him, and
a hatless youth in M.G.'s turned and
stared, but he did not notice them—his
gaze was rigidly fixed upon the stretch
of road in front of him.  This was the
Saturday before Bank Holiday, and the
pavements were crowded with shoppers at
the same time as the roads were full of
traffic pouring down to the seaside.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick drove with his right foot ever
ready to be transferred in haste to the
brake pedal: there were adventures every
hundred yards, what with pedestrians so
bent upon the business of shopping that
they had no idea whether they were on
the pavement or the road, and shopping
housewives in cars pulling out unexpectedly
from the kerb, and motor-buses to
be passed when they stopped.  A great, big
adventure this—and the apparently
impassable passage between trams and the
kerb to be negotiated, and, as well as all
this, stops to be made occasionally here
and there.  For this was no mere pleasure
cruise.  Pethwick was driving this car
today bent upon the furtherance of the
new plan.
</p>

<p>
Every stop he made was somewhere near
a radio shop—not very near, in some
cases, as he could never bring himself to
drive across the road and it took him
some time always to get in to the kerb,
and there had to be fifty yards clear of
parked vehicles before he could attempt
it.  But wherever he stopped, he made his
way on foot back to the radio shop which
had caught his eye, and at every shop he
bought a couple of accumulators.
</p>

<p>
For this new plan of his he needed
electrical power in some quantity, from a
portable source, and it was only by buying
accumulators and taking them about in
a motor-car that he could achieve this.
Half an ampere at a hundred volts would
be impossible to supply in any other
manner.  And Pethwick was not going to call
attention to himself by buying twenty-five
thirty-ampere-hour accumulators at
a single shop.
</p>

<p>
Yet nowadays anyone can buy a couple
of accumulators without attracting special
attention, and that was what Pethwick
did.  His route through the suburbs was
blazed with thirteen stops to buy
accumulators, just as a man buying poison
will visit a dozen chemists' shops to
obtain a sufficient supply.  By the time
Pethwick had finished his round the floor of
the poor old Morris was completely covered
with accumulators laid side by side.
</p>

<p>
Then he drove back, to the incredibly
difficult operation of getting the car up
the alley-way and into the garage again.
His legs were all of a tremble by the time
he had done it.
</p>

<p>
Even then there was still much to be
done.  He had to take the train up to
London Bridge, and a bus from there to
Hammer Court, and he had to come all
the way back again with the suitcase
which for ten days had lain locked in the
cupboard of his office.  This motoring
business had one very great advantage; the
garage which he had contracted to pay
young Lenham eight shillings a week
provided him with a secure sanctuary
additional to the one at Hammer Court.  He
could switch on the light there and lock
his door, and sit in the secure stuffiness
inside and tinker with his apparatus
without fear of interruption.
</p>

<p>
That was how he spent his afternoon,
sitting on ah old packing-case left by the
preceding tenant with his feet in a puddle
of oil, rewinding his armatures and
adapting his condenser to the new source of
current.  There was in existence only one
set of apparatus for the production of the
Klein-Pethwick Effect, and that was
incredibly crude and homemade, but it
worked—recent events had proved that.
In that it was like the crude but effective
appliances with which Faraday had first
explored the electro-magnetic world.
</p>

<p>
Now Pethwick had to alter it to suit,
direct current in place of alternating, a
hundred volts instead of two hundred and
twenty, and it took a long time with his
lack of tools and in that bad light.  It
was late when he reached home again.
</p>

<p>
Even Pethwick was surprised at not
being greeted by his wife with a storm of
abuse on his eventual arrival, but the
poor man was so desperately weary, so
sick with hunger and fatigue, that he
could draw no conclusions from her
ominous silence.  He did not guess at the
thunder in the offing.  All he was conscious
of at the moment was that the work had
progressed.
</p>

<p>
He had learnt to drive a car, and he
had constructed an apparatus capable of
being transported in that car.  Whenever
he chose now he could produce the
Klein-Pethwick Effect—for a few hours, until
his accumulators were discharged—anywhere
in England that he should think
proper.
</p>

<p>
The thought of that; even made him
smile a little, despite his miserable feeling
of isolation, as he crawled into bed.  He
slept heavily the moment he turned over
on his side, and, such was his exhaustion,
he slept without movement until late on
Sunday morning.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Experience had taught Dr. Pethwick
by now that if he wanted to save himself
time and trouble, it was better to put
the next scheme in hand while the present
one was under way.  Now that he was ready
to carry out the "new threats" that he had
uttered through the medium of <i>The Times</i>
it was advisable to start preparations for
his projected attempt upon Paris.  They
would call for time and tact, as he was
well aware.  He made the first approaches
that Sunday at dinner-time.  He tried to
speak with supreme offhandedness.
</p>

<p>
"Would you mind very much, dear," he
asked, "if I were to go away for a few
days next week?"
</p>

<p>
"Mind?" said Mary.  "Of course I'd mind.
Not that I'd notice much difference, the
way you've been leaving me alone all this
week."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Pethwick.  "Don't you
think you could manage without me just
for a day or two?"
</p>

<p>
"I've never heard of such a thing,"
snapped Mary.  "Where do you want to go
to?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Pethwick, and even he hesitated.
It was such a colossal innovation
which he was proposing.  "As a matter of
fact—I want to go abroad."
</p>

<p>
"Abroad!"
</p>

<p>
The only people Mary knew who had ever
crossed the Channel had done so twenty
years ago, in uniforms and under government
orders.  The thing was unheard of,
incredible.  Except that—and here Mary
stiffened with fright—except that she was
abroad, at that very moment.  Mary stared
at Pethwick, and Pethwick looked at Mary,
and failed to conceal his unease.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pethwick, trying as hard as
he could to keep the conversation on the
level of the commonplace.  "Lots of people
do, you know.  I want to go to Paris."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't—you can't go to <i>Paris</i>,"
said Mary.
</p>

<p>
She really meant that at the moment she
said it.  A day trip to Boulogne might
perhaps have seemed possible to her, but a
journey to Paris, where everyone talked
French, and involving the use of French
trains, and the eating of foreign messes,
and ending in a place proverbial for its
gaiety and wickedness, seemed to be an
experience which could not possibly
happen to someone whom she knew intimately.
</p>

<p>
"There doesn't seem to be any reason
why I shouldn't, if you can do without me,"
said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
"But how are you going to get there?
What do you want to do in Paris?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can go by boat and train the
same as everybody else does," said
Pethwick, with an apparent nonchalance which
he was really far from feeling on the point.
"And—Piffy's giving three lectures at the
University of Paris which I want to hear.
They ought to cover new ground, and I
don't want to miss them."
</p>

<p>
At the last moment, when Pethwick had
committed himself to this speech, he had
realized that the human factor had let
him down again—he had completely
forgotten the name of the eminent French
physicist he had intended to quote.  But
in the fleeting one tenth of a second
allowed him he had managed to invent a
name which might sound reasonable to
Mary's English ear; and apparently it did.
</p>

<p>
"Piffy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the man who wrote that paper
on hydrostatics which I was so interested
in last year."
</p>

<p>
Mary never knew what papers interested
her husband; certainly she never hoped to
remember anything on that subject for a
year.
</p>

<p>
"But he won't lecture in English."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick grinned as assuredly as he
could.
</p>

<p>
"The language of mathematics is much
the same anywhere," he said.  "I'll follow
his blackboard work all right, and his
bench demonstrations.  I think it'll be
worth going."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, you can't go by yourself."
</p>

<p>
In a clairvoyant moment Pethwick realized
that he had begun the conversation
in the wrong way.  He should have begun
by inviting Mary to accompany him to
Paris, and on her inevitable and indignant
refusal his hands would have been free.
As it was, if he were to invite her now she
would accept, because that would be something
different from his first proposal, and
would be consequently proof of victory.
And he would have no opportunity of
assailing Paris traffic from a hotel bedroom
if Mary were with him.  He was like a
general who has made a faulty deployment
of his army; only by hard fighting could
he hope to retrieve the initial tactical
error.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'm going," he said, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Not without me you're not."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're not."
</p>

<p>
Pethwick hit the table with his fist; he
tried to imitate what he thought would be
the behavior of Mr. Holliday dealing with
a pack of recalcitrant schoolboys.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going," he said, loudly.  "Once and
for all, I'm going.  And I don't want you
with me.  You'd only be in the way and we
can't afford it."
</p>

<p>
Naturally that was the point where
the quarrel began.  There is no need to
recount the details.  There were hard words
said on both sides because Pethwick,
wrought up to a pitch he had never reached
before, and reacting violently from his
recent overstrain, suddenly discovered that
he could use hard words, and he found a
savage pleasure—the greater because it
was new to him—in using them.
</p>

<p>
He let fly several vicious remarks, and
most of them were true enough, but they
upset Mary very badly indeed.  It was not
long before there were tears mingled with
her recriminations, and the sight of Mary
in tears, instead of having its usual effect
on Pethwick, made him in his present
unnatural condition more vicious than ever.
It ended—it would be accurate to say that
it reached an apparent end—in a manner
usual in domestic quarrels, although nearly
unprecedented in the Pethwick family; in
Pethwick rising to his feet and stalking
out of the room, and out of the house,
just like an ordinary husband.
</p>

<p>
Mary was left at home alone, to wipe her
eyes with a wet handkerchief, and to sniff
and sob herself into physical calm, with the
aid of repeated journeys to the sideboard
cupboard.  She had the afternoon to
herself, during which she could turn over in
her mind all the cruel things which Pethwick
had said to her.  Things which hurt
her the more, now that she brooded over
them, because of the truth they contained.
She knew now that her husband
did not love her, and, what was far worse,
she knew that he regarded her with as
much contempt as his nature allowed him
to feel towards any human being.
</p>

<p>
She might have borne with his hatred; it
was the contempt that rankled and her
vague feeling that the contempt was justified
was the poison on the barb.  There were
strange thoughts, and strange resolutions
forming in Mary's mind, all clouded and
muddled with whisky as it was.
</p>

<p>
The instinct of self-assertion grew up
in the maudlin reaction from tears.  If he
did not love her, then he must fear her.
She would hurt him, the beast, worse than
he had hurt her.  He might despise her, but
she would show him that she was not one
to be despised.  She would queer his pitch
for him, put a spoke in his wheel, ruin
all those fine schemes of his.  And she
would show him if he could go to Paris
when she did not want him to.
</p>

<p>
Under the quick stimulus of whisky
plans began to grow up in her mind to
give effect to the resolutions already
formed.  They were still there next
morning, when Mary came round from the
stupor into which the whisky had plunged
her.  The stupor in which Pethwick had
found her on his return from the visit he
had made to Chelsea, whither he had gone,
to inspect the lie of the land round about
Lots Road power station.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Bank Holiday dawned bright and
fair.  There had never been a summer
like this in human memory.  Every day
for weeks now there had been blue skies
and scorching sunshine.  Despite—or
perhaps because of—all the uncertainty in
the air, despite the wobbling foreign
exchanges, and the menacing political
outlook; despite unemployment and financial
stringency, people were spending more
money on holidays and amusements than
they had ever spent before.  The call of
the seaside had become, under the influence
of that beneficent sunshine, too insistent
to resist.  Every day there had been
a stream of motor-cars pouring out of
London seeking the sea, and on this day,
the height and summit of the holiday
season, the stream was redoubled.
</p>

<p>
Not merely on the roads was this the
case.  The railways, too, were doing better
business than they had known for years.
On Bank Holiday evening there were tens
of thousands of people pouring back into
the London termini.  There were all the
day trippers, to start with.  Then there
were the people who had been away for
the week-end.  Then there were all the
canny people who had chosen their week's
holiday or their fortnight's holiday so
that it terminated at Bank Holiday week-end
and thereby gained an extra precious day.
</p>

<p>
As darkness fell all these hosts of
people encumbered with tired, whimpering
children, with trunks and suitcases, with
spades and pails and golf clubs and
tennis rackets and bags and bundles and
baskets, all came back to London.  At the
termini the lucky ones with a few shillings
to spare, the careful ones who had made
provision for this in their budget for the
holiday, climbed into taxicabs.  Others got
into trams and buses.  But the larger half
used the underground trains; the
underground management's passenger graphs
showed a most unusual "peak" at
nine-thirty on Bank Holiday evening.
</p>

<p>
When at first the trains stopped and
the lights went out the crowds displayed in
nearly every case a praiseworthy freedom
from panic.  They endured the darkness
and the stuffiness with British stolidity.
But the hold-up was quite general.
Throughout the London district there was
not an underground train in motion, not
a glimmer of light, not a lift nor escalator
working.
</p>

<p>
The railway staff rose to the emergency
as far as was in their power.  In the
stations emergency lamps were lit, and in
the places where trains had stopped in or
very near stations the crowds were
extricated without much damage and guided in
the glimmer of the oil lamps and electric
torches up the never-ending stairs to the
surface, dragging their suitcases and their
babies and their golf clubs with them.
There were a good many pockets picked,
and everyone was exasperated—infuriated—by
this climax to a tiring day.
</p>

<p>
But in two trains far from stations the
business was very much worse indeed.  It
was stifling hot in the trains, and pitchy
dark—darker, perhaps, than those
town-bred people had ever known in all their
experience.  Here and there in the darkness
voices made themselves heard—the voices
of those inevitable people who always arise
in an emergency and shout out, "Keep
calm!  Keep calm!" and do nothing else to
allay the panic such cries are bound to
arouse.  Sometimes women fainted, and
anxious husbands began to elbow in the
crowd in order to find room to administer
to them.  Sometimes frightened, overtired
children began to cry, and from crying
passed on to screaming, when their
mothers had not the nerve and tact to comfort
them by an apparent freedom from anxiety.
</p>

<p>
So in these trains there was disgraceful
panic, during which in the pitch darkness
maddened crowds surged up and down the
long carriages.  Nobody could have said
what he was frightened about, but
everyone was pushing, fighting, scrambling to
get out of the trains.  There were children
trampled to death in those carriages—pitiful
little things who stood no chance once
they were caught in the alley-way between
the seats.  There were mothers who died
there, too, trying to hold the madmen back
from the bodies of their children.  In
places people tore open the doors and fell
to the ground with others piling on top
of them; ribs and legs were smashed, and
the long dark tunnels were filled with
screams of agony.
</p>

<p>
It was only for an hour that the trouble
endured, but in that hour four lives were
lost and a hundred were injured.  At the
end of that hour the lights suddenly came
on again, and the trains began to pick
their way cautiously along the lines, as
soon as the heaps of injured had been
cleared from the way, while Pethwick,
ignorant of the deaths he had caused, drove
the Morris away slowly from Tadema Road
and over Battersea Bridge.
</p>

<p>
He had pushed his way cautiously
through the Bank Holiday traffic in the
failing light.  It had occurred to him that
he must not on any account whatever risk
a smash with its subsequent disclosure of
the contents of his motor-car.  The weight
of the accumulators on the floor-boards
made the car sluggish in its acceleration
although easier to handle in other
respects, and overtaking was consequently
difficult to him.  Most of the way to
Battersea Bridge he was crawling behind
motor-buses, only passing them at the
stops, and then only occasionally.
</p>

<p>
Tadema Road was the site he had chosen
for his motor-car; from there he could
rake the whole long line of generators,
whose position could easily be deduced
from the lay-out of the power-station.  It
was almost dark when he reached the
place he had in mind, and halted the car
as far as possible from the nearest street
lamp.  Kneeling on the front seat he leant
over into the body of the car and made the
final connections.  He trained the emitter
upon the power-station, and closed the
switch.  The make-and-break began its
gentle buzz, but that sound was drowned
in the roar which went up from the
power-station, audible even in Tadema Road.
</p>

<p>
For under the influence of the Klein-Pethwick
Effect the huge magnets in the
dynamos lost their magnetism, and
instantly the armatures ceased to experience
the retarding drag upon them caused by
the magnetic field—the drag which is
overcome in doing the work which is
converted into electricity.  Freed from this
load, the armatures raced round; the
steam engines began to race too.  At each
generator the automatic governors, spinning
round at twice their designed speed,
began to lift the safety valves.
</p>

<p>
In the instant the whole power-station
was plunged into darkness and bathed in
escaping steam, through which the thunderstruck
staff tried to grope their way.
They were trained to deal with emergencies,
but they were not prepared for this
total, complete failure, nor for this
crippling darkness.  And however good their
training, there was nothing they could do
now, with every single generator as useless
as scrap metal.
</p>

<p>
The engineers discovered the cause of
the trouble almost instantly; indeed, no
one could very well miss that complete
lack of magnetism in the dynamos.
Immediately they began to try to telephone—but
most of the telephones were useless,
caught in the all-embracing sweep of the
Klein-Pethwick Effect.  Even telephones
contain magnets.  The management sent
messengers on foot helter-skelter through
the streets.  Pethwick saw them go by,
running madly along the dark pavements.
But they paid no attention to the shabby
old Morris car waiting beside the kerb, nor
to the driver sitting immobile at his wheel,
the quiet running of the engine quite
drowning the purr of the make-and-break
in the body of the car behind him.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
At the end of an hour Pethwick
switched off his instruments, put the
Morris into gear, and drove slowly towards
home.  It was late now, and he was
mortally tired.  He had no knowledge of how
much harm he had done; he could only
guess that he had caused a complete
suspension of traffic on the underground.  His
imagination had not been extensive enough
to visualize the dead children and the
injured women.
</p>

<p>
He crept over Battersea Bridge and
plunged into the suburban main roads on
his way back to the garage.  His fatigue
was such that he had to be even more
careful than usual in the traffic and it
was with pathetic relief that he swung the
Morris up the alley-way at the back of
Lenham's Service Station.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was fatigue; perhaps fatigue
merely accentuated the sheer unhandiness
of the motoring beginner, but Pethwick
got himself into a terrible muddle while
trying to induce the Morris to go into
the garage.  The car behaved with the
maddening obstinacy of mechanism in
unskilful hands.  Pethwick backed and
went forward; he sawed the wheel round
first this way and then that, but do what
he could he could not prevail upon the
car to make a neat clearance of the side
of the garage doorway.
</p>

<p>
In the end—it was really only to be
expected—there came the moment when
he trod heavily on the accelerator instead
of on to the brake, and with a rasp and
a crackle the side pillar crumpled up
the near side wing and bit into the running
board.  It was not a very bad scrape,
but it made matters hopeless for Pethwick.
It seemed as if he would never free the
car.  Whether he tried to go back or
forward the doorpost jarred up against the
side and stopped the engine.  Pethwick was
nearly frantic with mortification and fatigue.
</p>

<p>
Then, while he was out of the car trying
to rally himself and to work out scientifically
how to set about the job there
came a blaze of light around the corner
of the alley-way and another motor-car
halted at the sight of the tangle.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have hit a spot of trouble,
sir," said Lenham's voice.
</p>

<p>
Pethwick heard Lenham's car door slam
as he got out to inspect, and Lenham
came striding up.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's not as bad as it looks," said
Lenham.  "That running-board will spring
straight as soon as it's free.  Here—"
</p>

<p>
Before Pethwick could stop him—presumably
Pethwick's reactions were slowed
up by his fatigue—Lenham had pulled
open the door and sat himself in the
driver's seat.  He started the engine, put
pressure on the steering-wheel, let in the
clutch, and lo! the car swung away from
the door post.  A second later it was gliding
into the garage as if it had never displayed
a trace of mulish obstinacy in its life.
</p>

<p>
There was an odd look on Lenham's face
as he climbed out of the car again.
Pethwick was staring at him in fascinated
horror.  No one sitting in that car in a lighted
garage could have missed seeing the
contents and no one of Lenham's training
could have seen the accumulators ranged
on the floor and the instruments on the
back seat without guessing their purpose.
And Lenham had heard already that the
Peacemaker had been at work that evening
at Lots Road, although he had heard
no details.  Pethwick knew now the sick
fear of discovery.
</p>

<p>
But Lenham apparently had noticed
nothing.  After the first glance he looked
away until Pethwick had time to compose
his expression.  Maybe Lenham approved
of the Peacemaker's aims and methods;
it might merely be that Lenham was too
fond of Pethwick to accuse him;
conceivably Lenham was one of those people
who can mind their own business.
However it was, Lenham said nothing
whatever about the contents of the car.  He
peered down at the running-board.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," he said, and shook
it.  "There doesn't seem to be any real
damage done.  You've spoilt that wing, of
course, but you must expect to spoil a
wing or two while you're learning.  Just
remember, sir, don't go more than a foot
at a time until you're quite sure what the
car's going to do.  Well, good night, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good night," said Pethwick.
</p>

<p>
He stood still in the lighted garage; he
heard Lenham start up his car again, run
it in, and slam and lock the door.  Only
when his footsteps died away down the
alley did he break again into activity,
dismantling his apparatus and packing it
away hurriedly in the suitcase which had
stood there ever since he had brought it
down from Hammer Court.  Then, bending
under its weight, he started to carry it home.
</p>

<p>
There could be no using his apparatus in
his motor-car again until he had the
accumulators charged up, which he would
have to have done two by two as he had
bought them, and that would have to wait
until his return from Paris.  Despite his
sick apprehension he could not force his
mind to think about whether or not
Lenham would betray him.  All he could do was
to go on doggedly with the plans he had laid.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Pethwick had been right in his
assumption that <i>The Times</i> would penetrate
into whatever recess in Norway that
the Laxtons had chosen for their holiday.
Four copies together reached Mr. Henry
Laxton and his daughter as they sat
together at supper-time.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton had a keen appetite for
supper, which was sharpened rather than
dulled by the knowledge of what he was
going to eat—the trout which he had
caught that afternoon, and a loin of
delicious mountain mutton.  He had already
made the remark on sitting down to table
which he had made eight times before, that
the flat biscuits of Norwegian rye bread
were the ideal accompaniment to fresh
caught trout, and he was about to make
the remark he had made seven times before.
It was to the effect that he could not
understand how English biscuit
manufacturers dared to charge the prices they
did for the inferior substitutes which they
made in England and advertised so extensively.
</p>

<p>
What saved Dorothy from having to
listen to this and express the polite
surprise which she had expressed seven times
already was the arrival of the day's mail,
brought by the postman on his bicycle
with the clanging bell.  And included in
the mail were those four copies of <i>The
Times</i>.  Mr. Laxton fell upon them with
the ardor of an exile.
</p>

<p>
He was not selfish with his newspapers,
either.  Although he liked to have an
untouched newspaper to open, and to feel
quite sure that his were the first eyes to
rest upon the print inside, he did not mind
Dorothy picking up the copies as he
discarded them after a first hurried skimming
through.  A fussier father might have
insisted on her waiting until he had
completed the serious reading of them, which
he proposed to carry out after supper.
</p>

<p>
"It's extraordinary the things even <i>The
Times</i> publishes nowadays," said Mr. Laxton,
testily, putting down the first copy
and reaching for the second.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy said nothing—it was the sort
of remark to which it is hard to find a
reply—and took up the discarded paper.
</p>

<p>
"It's perfectly fantastic," said Mr. Laxton.
"It just shows where pacifism leads to."
</p>

<p>
But Dorothy said nothing at all.  She
had sat up rigid in her chair, for the
headlines in her copy of <i>The Times</i> were
those which announced the Peacemaker's
"manifesto."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!" said Mr. Laxton, quite
exasperated.  He put his copy of <i>The Times</i>
down beside him with a smack; the
gesture was doubly <i>a propos</i>, because the loin
of mutton was brought in at that moment,
and besides expressing his amazement at
the condition of the modern world, it
enabled him to attend to the carving.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" said Mr. Laxton.
"Haven't you finished your trout yet?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer; all Dorothy did
was to drop the first copy of <i>The Times</i>
in a muddle on the floor and reach for
the second.  Mr. Laxton regarded these
actions with distaste.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Dorothy, still reading <i>The Times</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laxton smacked the loin of mutton
with the flat of the carving knife.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy!" he said.  "Put that paper
<i>down</i> and attend to your supper."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy dropped the second number of
<i>The Times</i> in a muddle on top of the first,
and took up the sacred unopened third
one.  Mr. Laxton eyed her as though he
could not believe what he saw.  He was
on the point of an explosion, but his good
sense restrained him.  The only Englishman
in a village of foreigners, cooped up in
a three-room inn, will not readily quarrel
with the only English woman, even if she
is only his daughter.
</p>

<p>
He gesticulated to the maid to take away
Dorothy's plate with the neglected trout,
and addressed himself in silence to carving
the joint.  Dorothy dropped the third copy
of The Times in a muddle upon the
second and took up the fourth.  Mr. Laxton
carved her portion, and his own, and
began philosophically to eat the latter in
silence.  Then Dorothy dropped the fourth
copy of The Times upon the muddle on
the floor, and then made the muddle worse
by snatching up a page of it again to see
the date.
</p>

<p>
"What's the date today?" snapped Dorothy,
her eyes looking straight through her
father's head and through the wall
behind him.  "The sixth?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy looked at her watch and stood up.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going home," she said, still with
that strange far-away look in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't," said Mr. Laxton.  He
was not referring to physical obstacles; he
only meant that it was morally impossible
for a woman to leave an untasted loin of
mutton and walk at a moment's notice out
of an inn in a Norwegian fishing village en
route for a London suburb.
</p>

<p>
"Rolfsen's got a motor-boat," said
Dorothy, to no one in particular, and looking
at her watch again.  "He'll take me round
to Leka if I pay him enough.  It's daylight
nearly all night.  With luck I'll get the
local steamer there—just.  I'll be in Oslo
tomorrow.  I'll have to hurry."
</p>

<p>
With that, Dorothy proceeded to do just
what Mr. Laxton had recently visualized
as utterly impossible—she walked out of
the room, leaving her mutton behind and
started for the beach.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy!" said Mr. Laxton, plunging
after her.  "Dorothy!  You can't go like
this!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy did not appear to hear him.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't got any luggage," said
Mr. Laxton wildly.  "Why, you haven't
even got a hat and coat."
</p>

<p>
For the first time Dorothy noticed him.
</p>

<p>
"Then go and get my hat and coat," she
snapped at him over her shoulder.  "Quick!
I'll go and find Rolfsen."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
Even a man who had commanded a
brigade on the Western Front had to
yield obedience under the double shock of
surprise and this abrupt issuing of orders.
Mr. Laxton turned back to find the hat
and coat.  When he reached the beach with
them he found that Dorothy had already
routed Rolfsen out from his home and had
dragged him down to the little pier.  She
was saying, "Leka, Leka," and pointing to
the motor-boat, and displaying a sheaf of
hundred-kronen notes.  There was no need
for any dumb show to indicate her desire
for hurry; no one could look at her
without being aware of it.
</p>

<p>
Laxton could only stand by while Rolfsen
gradually realized what Dorothy
wanted.  A light of intelligence dawned
upon his stolid face.  He nodded and
smiled, took some of the notes and handed
the rest back to her.  Then he jumped with
his clumsy boots into the rocking motorboat
and stood waiting for her.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy took her hat and coat from her
father and prepared to jump in.  Laxton
looked round him wildly, at the towering
cliffs of the fjord, at the blue water and
the blue sky, and the red evening sun,
as if he doubted even the reality of these
things.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy!" he said.  "You can't go like
this.  What is it all about?"
</p>

<p>
For answer Dorothy put her hand in
Rolfsen's and sprang down into the boat
among the fish scales.  Rolfsen addressed
himself to starting up his motor, while the
assembled village began to cast off the
painters.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy!" said Laxton, in one final
appeal.  Then he yielded to the current
madness.  "Look here, you can't go by
yourself.  I'll come with you."
</p>

<p>
For answer the motor burst into a roar.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you," said Dorothy clearly.
Rolfsen leaped to the tiller, and the boat
surged away from the pier.  It roared down
the bay, pitching as it met the ocean swell.
Then it disappeared from sight as it
rounded the headland, and Laxton was
left alone on the pier, with a wondering
village eyeing him, and a congealing loin
of mutton still waiting him up at the inn.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy sat among the fish scales; her
knuckles were white with the tightness of
her grip upon the thwart.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry, hurry, hurry," she said to herself,
and the motor roared its encouragement.
The wind even on this glorious day
was cold out at sea, and soon there were
splashes of spray coming in over the bow,
but Dorothy noticed neither.  All she could
think of was Pethwick in London, with a
problem of world-wide importance on his
hands, facing enormous difficulties and
enormous perils, without a friend at his
side.
</p>

<p>
She had forgotten his unfaithfulness;
never once during that whole mad journey
did she think about the Pethwick child
that was soon to be born.  She could only
think of Pethwick encountering a rising
tide of public indignation and public
savagery.  She did not even think about
disarmament; it was only Pethwick.  She
must not leave him unbefriended in this
crisis.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry, hurry, hurry," she said.
</p>

<p>
The blue sea changed to grey as the sun
dipped lower.  Rolfsen, at the tiller, lit
his pipe and held his oilskin closer to him.
The cliffs of the coastline dwindled and
diminished as the boat cut a chord across
the shallow arc of the land, and the boat
began to pitch more wildly still.  Soon
Dorothy was sick.  She clutched the thwart
and vomited hideously, but not even the
miseries of sea-sickness could make her
forget the need for speed, and Pethwick's
need for comfort and succour.  The hours
went by, and the cliffs began to grow larger
again as the boat approached the land.
</p>

<p>
Close on the port side they passed a long
reef of rocks, over which the sea boiled
in white fury, and then Rolfsen put the
tiller over and headed direct for the shore,
steering apparently for an unbroken line
of cliffs.  But in half an hour the mouth of
a fjord became apparent, and ten minutes
after that they were swinging round the
headland.
</p>

<p>
As they opened up the length of the
fjord Rolfsen spoke for the first time and
pointed ahead.  It was the local steamer
which he indicated; she had cast off from
the pier and was leading down the bay.
Dorothy beat her hands together frantically,
and Rolfsen nodded reassurance.  He
turned the boat a trifle, and, leaping on
the thwart, he bellowed like a bull across
the quiet water.
</p>

<p>
There was a bustle on deck, and five
minutes later the boat surged up alongside
the steamer, to where a rope ladder was
waiting.  With a kick and a struggle
Dorothy scrambled on to the low deck, under
the eyes of the Norwegian fisherwives and
German tourists and the supercilious gaze
of the inevitable couple of English people
to be found on any deck anywhere in August.
</p>

<p>
That was well so far, but when Dorothy
reached Oslo in the afternoon there was
delay.  There was nothing—not even an
aeroplane—to help her on her way to
England until next morning.  The travel
agencies were sympathetic but firm.  Dorothy
had to spend the night in an hotel, trying
to sleep, but failing, and catching herself
saying to herself every five minutes,
"Hurry, hurry, hurry—" all unavailingly.
</p>

<p>
The morning brought her a far more
recent copy of <i>The Times</i>, Saturday's
edition, only two days old, and in it she
read of the "Fresh Threats" by the
Peacemaker, and of the universal condemnation
of the Peacemaker's methods.  She guessed
that Pethwick must be in serious danger.
He must be in need of counsel and advice
and friendship.  There was never a doubt
in her mind but that he was playing a lone
hand, pitting his own unaided efforts
against the world.  All her knowledge as a
student of history told her of the fate of
the men who had tried to impose reform
by force—Joseph II, of Austria, was the
one she had most clearly in mind—and
she had no doubt, now, as to Pethwick's
ultimate failure.
</p>

<p>
And his failure would put him in serious
danger, danger of violence, of prison.  He
would be held up to the scorn and derision
of the world, her father would dismiss
him from the staff of the Liverpool School,
and he would be plunged into poverty and
starvation.  Her only thought was that she
must be by his side.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
The afternoon found her on board the
steamer for England, dreadfully tired,
horribly sea-sick, fretting herself to rags
as the steamer ploughed its slow way
through the fog, with the siren continuously
sounding.  When at last, after miserable
delays, she set foot on English ground
again, almost the first sight to meet her
eyes were the ranged placards of the
book-stall.  "Peacemaker Causes Deaths," said
one.  "Find the Peacemaker!" said another.
</p>

<p>
She bought every paper she could find,
and read them feverishly in the train from
Humber to London.  The first headlines
she read stared at her from the page in
words of doom.  "The Innocent Blood,"
she read.  Then followed a lurid account
of last night's panic in the Tube trains;
it described the murdered children and the
injured women, the madness and the
confusion which had overwhelmed London on
Bank Holiday evening, the most important
holiday in the working people's year.  No
words could be too bad for the man who
had caused all this damage; Dorothy
glanced feverishly through column after
column of fierce condemnation.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy bitterly told herself, as she read,
that the hidden powers opposed to
disarmament were rallying, and directing
this offensive upon the Peacemaker.  She
tried to assure herself that all this was
merely so much propaganda, to be
discounted as heavily as all propaganda
should be discounted, but she found no
comfort in that.
</p>

<p>
The next newspaper was the one which
had said "Find the Peacemaker!" on its
contents bill.  The words were repeated as
a headline on the front page.  This paper
called upon the people of England, and
more especially the people of London, to
hunt down this slayer of children.
</p>

<p>
Some historically well-read person on the
staff instanced the case of Napoleon on
the island of Lobau, at the crossing of the
Danube, who paraded his whole army at
the news that there were spies present,
and ordered every man to look at the man
on his right and the man on his left, and
to call his officer if either appeared
suspicious.  Every spy in the ranks was at
once detected by this means, and—as the
article accentuated with bloodthirsty
cunning—every spy was promptly shot.
</p>

<p>
The people of London must do the same.
As the Peacemaker must be somewhere in
London, let everyone consider deeply
whether his neighbor on the right or his
neighbor on the left might be he.  Hotel
proprietors, lodging-house keepers, house
agents, all must make the same effort.
The newspaper contemplated the consequent
reign of terror which would probably
take place with equanimity, much as
a year or two before it had seen no harm in
the possible institution of a dictatorship.
The Peacemaker must be routed out, taken,
and punished.
</p>

<p>
The article went on to find satisfaction
in the fact that this freak of the
Peacemaker's had exasperated everybody so
much that the paper was confident that
everyone would organize to catch him.
</p>

<p>
There was this point to be made quite
clear, that the law of England contained
no punishment fitting for the miscreant.
It was quite possible that justice might in
this case miscarry, and if the Peacemaker
fell into the hands of the police he might
get off with some absurd sentence like five
years.  That would be intolerable; the
newspaper yearned for the existence of laws
like those of Henry VIII, which contemplated
burning or boiling alive as usual
events.  Men who committed robbery with
violence were to this day flogged as well
as imprisoned.  Ethically, the Peacemaker
was as guilty as they; had he not tried
by violence to rob the English people of
their most sacred possession, constitutional
government?  Let everyone bear this
well in mind.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy put down the newspaper; she
felt sick again, and not sea-sick or
train-sick, either.  The very next newspaper she
picked up was the evening paper under
the same ownership as the one she had
just been reading, and this, too, bore the
headline "Find the Peacemaker."  It
announced with triumph that the suggestion
made that morning to form organizations
to hunt down the Peacemaker had
met with enthusiastic praise.  Already
there were such organizations being
formed; they quoted examples in the City,
in Crouch End, in Acton.
</p>

<p>
That showed that the heart of the
English people was as sound as ever, and
was not enfeebled by all this poisonous
Pacifist stuff which had lamentably got
into circulation lately.  There could be no
doubt that before very long the Peacemaker
would be laid by the heels and would
meet with his deserts, and England would
have triumphantly freed herself from the
suspicion, under which she labored in the
eyes of other nations, that she was tainted
with the desire for disarmament, with
Pacifism, and with similar Bolshevist doctrines.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's mouth tightened into a hard
line.  She knew the day had come when
the label "Pacifist" could be applied to a
man as a term of reproach, just as in
other days it was usual to style one's
opponent as Radicals, or Methodists, or
Atheists, or Mormons.
</p>

<p>
Yet Dorothy did not follow up this line
of thought.  The historical development
of the movement in favor of disarmament
meant little to her at the moment.  All
she wanted was to be at Pethwick's side.
She found herself sitting forward in the
railway carriage, with the piled-up
newspapers round her, her elbows on her knees,
saying to herself, "Hurry, hurry, hurry."  The
rhythm of the train beat out a monotonous chorus.
</p>

<p>
At the terminus she was the first out of
the train, the first into a taxicab.  She
gave the driver Pethwick's address.  What
she was going to do there she had not the
least idea, but she would not endure a
moment's delay before seeing him.  Her
clothes were crushed and shabby with
travel, and she felt filthy, but, although
the idea occurred to her, she would not go
home first to change.  She tried ineffectively
to brush herself clean with her hands as
they drove through the streets.
</p>

<p>
The taxicab slithered on the tramlines
of the familiar High Street; it passed
Lenham's garage and the Library, and then
Dorothy had to put her head but of the
window to direct the driver to turn up
Verulam Road.  Verulam Road was thick
with people, and as they reached the
corner of Launceton Avenue Dorothy knew
she had arrived too late.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
It is ironical that a woman like Mary
Pethwick should have twice diverted
the course of the history of the world;
that by one betrayal she should have
brought the Peacemaker into being, and
by another have annihilated him.  Even
Judas had only the one opportunity.  But
her husband had exasperated her beyond
all endurance.  On Bank Holiday he had
been out until very late at night, and
condescended to no attempt at explaining his
absence at a moment when Mary would
rather have been told the lie she was
expecting than that she should be so ignored.
And on the Tuesday following Bank Holiday,
on the 8th of August, his behavior was
worse still.  Immediately after reading <i>The
Times</i> at breakfast he had plunged from
the room.
</p>

<p>
Mary had found him afterwards walking
around the house, wandering from
room to room, into her kitchen, up and
down the hallway, up and down the stairs,
until she was furious with him, and yet he
had said no word to her.  She had scolded
him sharply for getting in her way, and
elicited no reply.  Then he went up into
the spare bedroom, which was such an
unusual thing for him to do that she
followed him there, as was only to be
expected, and demanded what in the world
he wanted there.
</p>

<p>
And then at last he had turned on her,
with his face as white as a sheet and
distorted with some emotion or other, and
he had taken her by the shoulders as
though to shake her.  But on the instant he
had calmed himself and had merely turned
her round and pushed her gently out of the
room, and not before she had caught sight
of a brand-new suitcase which she had
never seen before.
</p>

<p>
The door was shut upon her before she
could ask why or wherefore, and of course
it was a point on which she demanded
information.  She could not be expected to
tolerate the presence in the house of an
unexplained suitcase, especially when her
husband had earlier announced his
unalterable decision to go to Paris soon.  She
tried to open the door to ask questions,
but Pethwick held it against her, and
when she pushed upon it he turned the
key in the lock.
</p>

<p>
Mary could not bear to be locked out of
anywhere.  The bare thought of it drove
her perfectly frantic.  She beat upon the
door with her fists; she even went
downstairs and brought up the coal hammer
and battered ineffectually with that,
chipping off the paint and denting the wood,
but not effecting an entrance.  It was
maddening that her husband should lock
himself in there away from her, where she
could not see what he was doing, and the
more she went to the sideboard cupboard
the more frightened she became.
</p>

<p>
In the end it was perfectly excusable,
considering her condition, that she should
put on her shabby hat and her unbrushed
coat and go out to where she could find
comfort, and where, sitting in the
comfortable bar, she could whisper what she
wanted to say to someone else, who at first
smiled and did not believe her, but who,
on her repeated and vehement assurances,
gradually became convinced, and
convinced to such an extent that in the end
he rose up and went out through the
swinging doors to carry the word.
</p>

<p>
And the dark planning which had
reached its maturity thus in Mary's mind
had been cunning and well-timed.  She had
chosen the right recipient for the news, so
that although the word was passed from
mouth to mouth all through that long
afternoon, no whisper reached the police.
It was only when evening came that it
even reached the newspaper men, and then
it was too late.
</p>

<p>
All through that afternoon Mary sat
downstairs, only near drunk, while
Pethwick remained locked in the spare
bedroom, mourning the dead children, face to
face with failure, trying most desperately
hard to decide what he should do next.
He had set his mind to the task, and he
was not the type which withdraws when
the work is only half completed.  But to
carry on, in face of the rising-tide of
hatred—which even <i>The Times</i> indicated,
although he had seen nothing of the
inflammatory articles in the cheaper press—and
with the knowledge that he had killed
little children, seemed just as difficult.
</p>

<p>
He was desperately miserable; he seemed
quite unable to come to any decision or to
form any plan.  It was not until late in the
day that in desperation, to distract his
tortured mind, he laid out his apparatus on
the floor, and got out his long sheaf of
calculations and tried to concentrate upon
continuing the mathematical side of his
investigations.  He hoped that an hour or
two of higher mathematics would clear his
brain, or would, at any rate, tire it so
that this torturing river of thought would
cease.
</p>

<p>
Mary was ready to open the door to them
when they came, half a dozen of them up
the path to knock on the door and a dozen
more waiting on the pavement outside.
Only half of them were hooligans, street
book-makers' runners and such-like; the
others were high-spirited young men of
unimpeachable record, and the youngest
was Henry Laxton, junior, bronzed and fit
from his period at the O.T.C. camp.  They
were not going to kill Pethwick; they only
intended to take him out and duck him in
the lake on the common, just to teach him
a lesson before the police got hold of him.
</p>

<p>
"I was expecting you boys," said Mary,
when she opened the door.  "He's upstairs—locked
himself in this morning.  That room."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
They went up the stairs and knocked
on the door.
</p>

<p>
"We want you, Pethwick," said the quiet
leader, and at the sound of the strange
voice Pethwick rose and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
They took him by the arms and dragged
him out, not resisting very much, with on
his face the half-hearted, good-natured
smile he had worn as a boy when he had
been ragged at school.  The circumstances
seemed just the same to him, and the
memory of those times came flooding back
to him.
</p>

<p>
They brought him downstairs, and as
they led him into the street the quiet
leader said to the hooligans:
</p>

<p>
"There are all his infernal machines
upstairs.  See that nothing's left of them."
</p>

<p>
And on that invitation they poured up
the stairs and they pounded his apparatus
to pieces, and they took all his pages of
closely written calculations and tore them
into fragments and piled them on the
floor and set fire to them, and, their
appetite for destruction growing, they ranged
through the house, breaking open drawers,
and every scrap of paper they found they
piled upon the flames, with broken
furniture, until they had set the whole house
well alight, so that when the fire engine
arrived the firemen had to complete the
destruction of all Pethwick's work in
extinguishing the flames with their hoses
and their chemicals.
</p>

<p>
Out in the street they led Pethwick
towards the common.  But now the news
spread like wildfire that they had caught
the Peacemaker.  People came pouring out
of their houses.  From the slums on the
other side of the High Street came more
hooligans, running and shouting.  Some
of them remembered the happy war-time
days when German bakers and linen-drapers
had had their shops sacked.  The
streets filled with a yelling crowd of
mischief-makers and of exasperated people, in
the midst of which Pethwick was borne
along, now and again lifted off his feet by
the press.  It is not known who it was that
threw the first stone, but it is to be hoped
that it was somebody without sin.  It
struck Pethwick on the cheek, and the
blood poured down, and the crowd yelled.
</p>

<p>
That was when Dorothy saw him, head
and shoulders above the crowd, the blood
on his cheek.  But on his face was still the
same dazed, good-natured smile.  She could
comfort herself, <i>afterwards</i>, with the
thought that he was unafraid.  Then into
the mob came charging the half-dozen
rescuers with young Lenham at their
head—Lenham had heard the news, and his
dark face was set hard with his
determination not to let Pethwick suffer.
</p>

<p>
There were blows struck, and the mob
surged and eddied this way and that, and
Pethwick went down among the trampling
feet, and rose again, bruised and dazed,
until someone unknown, in the press of
the battle, struck him down again with a
coward's blow, so that he fell once beneath
the feet of the mob pouring over him in
their aimless riot for five wild minutes,
until the police at last came fighting their
way up Verulam Road.  He was still breathing
when they found him, but not for long.

                            <p>Collaborative Up-voting List is a web-based application for people to organize their papers/readings and share their reading list. We are building it as a group of 4 people.</p>

                            <p class="date">Jan 2016 – April 2016</p>
                            <p>Scaling-pancake was an Android app for people to trade their instrument.
                                I was the main tester of a group of 5 people.
                                I wrote all the automation UI tests for our app using open-source tool Robotium.
                                <a href="https://github.com/CMPUT301W16T08/scaling-pancake">Here</a> is the link to our GitHub for the app .</p>

                            <p class="date">Jan 2016 – April 2016</p>
                            <p>More Than A Dream was a 3D story-driven puzzle solving roleplay game.
                                I was the lead programmer of a 6 people. I chose and designed most of the algorithm and mechanics we use in the game.
                                About three fourth of mechanics and cut scenes in the whole game was made by me.
                                I really enjoyed working with my team. The only regret is that the engine we were using was Microsoft Project Spark which now closed down.</p>
